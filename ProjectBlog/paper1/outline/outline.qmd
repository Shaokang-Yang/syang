## Theories

### Convoy model of social support

In social psychology, the convoy model of social relations is a theory that suggests individuals go through life surrounded by a personal network of family, friends, and acquaintances that provide both social support and a buffer against the negative effects of life's stressors. This "convoy" changes over time in size and composition, adapting to the individual's needs and circumstances.

1.  **Structure**: Each person's social network—termed a "convoy"—consists of layers of relationships ranging from close, intimate connections (like family and close friends) to more distant and less intense relationships (like acquaintances and colleagues).

2.  **Function**: These social convoys serve various functions, including emotional support (such as love and care), instrumental support (such as help in physical tasks or financial assistance), and informational support (such as advice and guidance).

3.  **Change over Time**: The composition and function of these convoys can change over time due to life events, transitions, and aging. For example, the network may expand or contract, and the nature of the support provided might shift as people enter different stages of their life.

## Core-periphery model of social networks

Intuitively, the concept of the network core usually refers to a central AND densely connected set of network nodes, while the periphery of the network denotes a sparsely connected, usually non-central set of nodes, which are linked to the core.
