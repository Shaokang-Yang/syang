<td><p>Thank you for your constructive comments. Yes, the analysis with this approach and an alternative approach show similar estimation results. The objective of the approach is to search for the missing contacts’ social network information from the closest neighbors’ social network surveys. This approach starts from a forward lookup followed by a backward lookup for missed contacts in the current wave of social networks. We also conducted an alternative lookup approach by searching for the missing contacts backward first and then forward, which could work as robustness checks.</p>
<p><img src="images/search - bf-01.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In both&nbsp;cases, we borrow the missed contacts’ network features from the closest wave that the contact exists. By doing this, we could have a relatively complete social network.&nbsp; The estimation with an adjusted approach is <strong>mostly consistent</strong> with earlier estimations:</p>
<p><img src="images/clipboard-2450557691.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The results suggest that an increase in core number could lead to a decrease in screen time, which is consistent with the original estimation.</p></td>

<td><p><em>“dynamic social network”</em></p>
<p>Actually this definition is not clear. Social networks can be dynamically measured (i.e.&nbsp;they are repeated snapshots). Would these be dynamic? In reality, you are taking a cross-sectional snapshot of a social network and dynamically measuring activation. You actually do not have dynamic social network data.</p></td>
<td><p>Thank you for pointing that out. It sill should be noted that there are two levels of social network features in our study:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Individual level</strong>. Contacts’ original network features come from the social network survey, therefore, they are updated over the waves of surveys.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cluster/group level</strong>. Everyday, participants selectively activate a group of individual contacts. The network features of the activated cluster change day by day.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is true that individual’s social network features evolve survey by survey rather than day by day. Nevertheless, our <strong>independent variables</strong> are the average social network features of the entire <strong>cluster</strong> of contacts that are activated on a certain day. Depending on which contacts are activated, the characteristics of the activated cluster change on daily level. For example, if a participant activate the following contacts on day t:</p>

<p>Unless we define this (super clearly it could be confusing, we may want to use another, less loaded term (e.g.&nbsp;“phone overuse”</p></td>

<p>Our findings reveal that the topology or structure of one’s social network impacts individuals’ behavior.

Our study advances the understanding of social engagement from volume to the structure of social communities.</p></td>

<p>Here there is this argument again. I’m not sure what we are saying. At points it sounds like we are saying that smartphone addiction is related to social isolation. Alternatively, social isolation could lead to smartphone overuse, both seem credible but the latter is more sensical for our story so we should be clear about this throughout the paper.</p></td>

<p>“……we narrow down the research questions to smartphone overuse, which is an emerging social and technical problem that is broadly thought to be a consequence of social isolation<span class="citation" data-cites="zeng2022">(<a href="#ref-zeng2022" role="doc-biblioref">Zeng et al. 2022</a>)</span>”.</p></td>

<td><p><em>” ……we measure a social network member’s core number, which measures how well a contact is connected with other contacts and how active the contact’s community is.”</em></p>
<p>This is crucial and should be more clearly described. What about centrality? There is a key theoretical construct here which is measured in different ways. So we should identify the key construct and how the two measures we have differ (and by extension setting up why they may different effects).</p></td>
<td><p>Thank you for your thorough advice. I think the following theoretical construct could be related to our study:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Social influence. The construct reflects the capacity of certain nodes in a social network to affect others’ behavior, opinion, and decisions-making process <span class="citation" data-cites="izuma2017">(<a href="#ref-izuma2017" role="doc-biblioref">Izuma 2017</a>)</span>. (Social influence. could be a construct for degree centrality and K-Core)</p></li>
<li><p>Group cohesion. The construct describes to which degree group members are attracted and connected in their group. Group cohesion can be based on shared goals or interests, emotion support, and group pride. Evidence suggests that group cohesion is positively correlated with team performance <span class="citation" data-cites="paulus2011">(<a href="#ref-paulus2011" role="doc-biblioref">Paulus, Kohn, and Dzindolet 2011</a>)</span>. (The constructs fits better for K-Core)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I take “social influence” as the theoretical construct for now. The statement is modified as follow:</p>
<p><em>In addition to the fundamental network metrics such as size and number of edges, we utilize degree centrality and K-core to identify the vital contacts with high social influence in a network that could have the potential to motivate broader social engagement. The former feature captures the degree to which a contact itself is connected to other contacts. Meanwhile, the latter further considers the connectivity degree of the sub-network to which a contact belongs.</em></p>
<p>I wonder if we should identify one theoretical construct for both degree centrality and K-core. Or, should we use two theoretical constructs for degree centrality and K-core separately.</p></td>

<td><p><em>“However, the number of connections of an activated network does not contribute to curbing smartphone use. Moreover, our results suggest that activating contacts in one’s social network can curb smart- phone use.”</em></p>
<p>These seem like opposite results, are they? Is the first result suggesting that network size does not have an effect? More generally, I wonder if we should kick things off with the more basic measures and then lead into the new more comprehensive measures. The story is that social networks are rich constructs with some simpler measures (number of nodes, size, etc.) and some more advanced measures that capture richer dynamics. Part of the contribution is leaning into the richer context and using real time data reveal more insight compared to the simple stuff. Need to tell this story more comprehensively.</p></td>
<td><p>This interpretation is not so clear. Here is the more detailed interpretation of the current results:</p>
<p>Our results show that activating contacts with high K-core can significantly reduce smartphone overuse time, with a more substantial reduction effect on non-communicative use than communication-driven use. Specifically, one standard deviation increase in core number leads to a 5.7-minute decrease in non-communication screen and a 5.34% decrease in overuse rate. However, activating contacts with a high degree centrality does not help curb smartphone overuse. The distinction between the effects of the two features suggests that contacts with a high K-core, which are those embedded in a cohesive group, have a stronger capability to motivate social engagement and project social influence. Furthermore, we find that the size of an activated social network reduces non-communicative screen time but increases communicative screen time. The two types of effects offset each other and result in no significant impact on overall screen time. The two types of effects offset each other and result in no significant impact on overall screen time. Moreover, we find that the impact of social network features does not vary with mobile communication level. Our results reveal that once a cluster of social networks is activated, the communication level does not influence the impact of the activated cluster, even though the activation itself is based on communication events.</p></td>

<td><p><em>“There are generally two types of social isolation: social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. Social disconnectedness refers to the status that someone lacks contacts or social con- nections.”</em></p>
<p>These are interesting constructs which waiver in their centrality to the story. Do they correlate with our social network measures, are there other measures that capture these distinctions?</p></td>
<td><p>It is interesting to explore the distinction between social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. In our data, there are three types of perceived loneliness: romantic loneliness, family loneliness and social loneliness. We can use the number of activated contacts per day as a proxy of social disconnectedness. Here is some descriptive results:</p>
<p>The correlation between family loneliness and social disconnectedness:</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-8.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="images/paste-2.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The figure suggests that high family loneliness is correlated with more screen time regardless of the number of contacts activated.</p>
<p>The correlation between romantic loneliness and social disconnectedness:</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-9.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="images/paste-4.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The figure suggests that low romantic loneliness is correlated with high screen time regardless of the number of contacts activated.</p>
<p>The correlation between social loneliness and social disconnectedness:</p>
<p><img src="images/paste-10.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><img src="images/paste-3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The figure suggests that high social loneliness is correlated with high screen time when participants’ activated contacts are at bottom 20% or top 20%.</p></td>

<td>It appears to be that those with higher core-number are mostly close friends. Then one could say that the story is actually much simpler: merely engaging with close friends is what matters. Can you argue for using network features, like core-number, against more intuitive metrics such as contact closeness in this context?</td>
<td><p>Thank you for your constructive comments. We measured the social distance of smartphone users with their contacts, as well as their level of trust in those contacts, which are the common measurement of interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p>The estimation of the above two constructs suggest that they do not have significant impact on participants smartphone use behavior. Please refer to Table 5:</p>

<td>A fundamental assumption is that social interactions mainly occur through calls and messages. Although the author has presented data showing a link between self-reported interaction levels and observed call/message frequencies, this doesn’t establish that calls/messages are the primary channels of interaction. People could have spent more time on other social platforms and offline activities (with the time spent also aligning with the self-reported interaction levels). How do you plan to address these potential unobserved interactions? Or can you justify they don’t affect your results?</td>
<td><p>This is an important issue that we need to address. Thanks for pointing this out. Indeed, there could be unobservable social engagements that are not based on phone call and message: 1) social interactions on other mobile applications; 2) physical interactions that are not based on phone call or messages.</p>
<p>First, for the social interactions happening on other platforms, it is indeed unobservable in our data set. However, based on the market share of the most popular mobile messaging channels, our data covered the leading four channels (Whatsapp, Phone calls, Facebook messager and Texting (SMS):<img src="images/channel.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Therefore, we suppose that our data has covered the majority of mobile communication activities.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of the unobserved offline social interactions, there could be two categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Smartphone users’ offline social interactions were initiated by online communication and then it was swithed to offline social interaction. In this situation , the activation of social network is activated by smartphone communication. This scenario could support our 1 &amp; and 2 hypothesis: activating embedded contacts and interacting with them could facilitate offline social engagement.</p></li>
<li><p>The primary concern is the <strong>offline social interaction is independent of smartphone communication</strong>. In another word, the activation of social network is not based on smartphone communication. Nevertheless, 67.91% (90134/132709) of our observations are in session, which means students are on campus. For those observations, unobserved social interactions within family are ruled out. We speculate that students started with online social engagement except those with their roommates.</p></li>

<td>The implications from your findings are also not clear. The current results show reduced smartphone use when engaging high “core-number” contacts. Does this suggest that one should have more interactions with such contacts to minimize their screen time? But the effect seems to be muted for the heaviest smartphone users, meaning this strategy wouldn’t be effective for those who might be really addicted.</td>
<td><p>We identified smartphone users who are addicted to smartphone. To the best of knowledge, there is no quantitative definition of smartphone addiction. We define smartphone addiction based on multiple criterias:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Observations with daily screen time that are greater than 5 hours (300 minutes).</p></li>
<li><p>Observations with daily screen time that are ranked top 10%, 20%, 30% among population.</p></li>
<li><p>Top 10 % screen time observations for each individuals’ observations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We then estimated the probability of addiction with a logit model:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\begin{align} \ln \left(\frac{\operatorname{Pr}\left(\text { Addiction }_{i t}=1 \mid \boldsymbol{X}_{i t}\right)}{1-\operatorname{Pr}\left(\text { Addiction }_{i t}=1 \mid \boldsymbol{X}_{i t}\right)}\right) &amp;= \nonumber \\ &amp;\quad \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \cdot \text{Social Network Features}_{it} \nonumber \\ &amp;\quad+ \alpha \cdot X_{it} + \theta_{i} +\lambda_{t} + \varepsilon_{it}\end{align}\)</span></p>
<p>All estimation results show that the increase in core number is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of smartphone addiction. For example:</p>

<p>2) the communication event type is a message (SMS, MMS, or WhatsApp) and there are both ‘<strong>outgoing</strong>” and’<strong>incoming</strong>” messages (SMS, MMS, or WhatsApp).</p>
<p>The above two conditions could ensure a&nbsp;<strong>two-way&nbsp;communication (an effective activation)</strong> exists between two smartphone users.&nbsp;This eliminates the possibility of one-way communication: one only sends or receives&nbsp;communication information. Overall, the estimation results are <strong>mostly consistent with earlier results</strong> after the adjustment.</p>
