    "text": "Since we find the screen time has a U-shape impact on sleep debt, we may wonder what mechanisms behind it. The following figure implies that sleep debt may have a reverse shape of sleep debt. Therefore, we may want to explore whether the U-Shape of sleep debt is caused by the reverse U-shape of message.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, one may be concered the rise of sleep debt after turning point may be driven by the potential outliers in the last two bars (screen time &gt; 80 minutes). However, whether these observations are outliers cannot be determined solely by their proportion of the total dataset. We have 506 unique participants in our final data set. There are 353 (69.76% of total participants) unique participants whose screen time has ever been greater than 80 minutes; 293 (57.91% of total participants)participants whose screen time has ever been greater than 85 minutes. It suggests that a large proportion of participants contributed to the data of last two bars. This might mean that those observations are not anomalies but a representation of a segment of the population, which reflects the inherent nature of the data (Osborne and Overbay, n.d.). Moreover, the U-shape persists in all the variations of measurement window:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure suggest that the U-shape always converge in the predictive models over the variation of measurement windows. Therefore, we believe those observations reflects the real-world variability. Maintaining outliers can sometimes contribute to the integrity and reliability of research findings‚Äã(Bakker and Wicherts 2014).\nCausal mediation analysis can help us to understand how an independent variable (IV) affects a dependent variable (DV) through a mediator variable (MV).\n\n\n\nMeiation Effect of Message\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%stata\n\nclear all\nset maxvar 120000, permanently\nset more off\n\nimport delimited \"/Users/shaokangyang/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sky.ang510@gmail.com/My Drive/Nethealth/Data/CNSA/combine/7/df7_22-5.csv\"\ngen date2 = date(date, \"YMD\")\n\n\n\n\n#| echo: true\n#| warning: false\n#| output: false\n#| code-overflow: wrap\n%%stata\n\nsgmediation2 sleep_debt, iv(screen_time) mv(message_q) cv(i.egoid i.date2 unlock call bytes length duration steps100 floors meanrate calorie_sum sedentaryminutes lightlyactiveminutes fairlyactiveminutes veryactiveminutes light_exposure  insession#weekday#time_wakeuphour i.studyweeks)\n\n\n\n\nSobel, Aroian, Goodman Tests: All three tests show a significant mediation effect.

This suggests that part of the effect of screen time on sleep debt operates through its impact on message frequency. Although the impact on the message is relatively small (0.014), since the message is measured in quartiles, it still could have a big impact.\nThe proportion of the total effect that is mediated (approx. 2.2%) indicates that a small but significant portion of the relationship between screen time and sleep debt is explained by message frequency.\n\nSummary:\n\nIncreased screen time is associated with both increased message and reduced sleep debt.\nThe direct effect of screen time on sleep debt is strong and negative, meaning screen time directly contributes to reducing sleep debt.\nThere is a significant but small mediation effect through message frequency, suggesting that part of the way screen time affects sleep debt is by influencing message frequency.\nOverall, the total effect of screen time on sleep debt, considering both direct and indirect pathways, is significant and negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndirect, Direct, and Total Effects:\n\na_coefficient (Effect of IV on MV): The effect of the independent variable on the mediator is -0.001, which is not statistically significant (p = 0.209).\nb_coefficient (Effect of MV on DV): The effect of the mediator on the dependent variable is -2.531 and is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001).\nIndirect_effect_aXb (Mediation Effect): The indirect effect, calculated as the product of a and b coefficients, is 0.003 but not statistically significant (p = 0.220).\nDirect_effect_c‚Äô (Direct Effect of IV on DV): The direct effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is 0.310, which is significant (p &lt; 0.001).\nTotal_effect_c (Total Effect of IV on DV): The total effect is 0.313, also significant (p &lt; 0.001).\n\nProportions and Ratios:\n\nProportion of total effect that is mediated: About 0.9% of the total effect is mediated, which is quite small.\nRatio of indirect to direct effect: The indirect effect is approximately 0.9% of the direct effect.\nRatio of total to direct effect: The total effect is 1.009 times the direct effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMediation Effect: The results suggest that the mediation effect in the model is not statistically significant.

To check whether the U-shaped relationship is caused by outliers, we reviewed the literature about the treatement of outliers and identified the following outlier treatment strategies: winsorization, trimming, and interquartile range method (Leone, Minutti-Meza, and Wasley 2019; Mitton 2022; Vinutha, Poornima, and Sagar 2018 ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinsorization replaces the extreme values with values at certain quartile cutoffs.

The following figure visualize the margin plot based on the above outlier treatment strategies:\n\nThe margins plot supports the existence of U-shaped relationship and the turning point are within the range of measurement windows (180 minutes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpline regressions estimate the coefficients of screen time on sleep debt piecewisely. Spline regressions are widely used to test the existence of U- and inverted U-Shaped relationships (Kesavan, Staats, and Gilland 2014; Huang et al. 2023; Tan and Netessine 2019; Xu, Tan, and Netessine 2022; Zou et al. 2023). For example, the following equation estimated the coefficients with 4 knots.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe vary the number of knots from 1 to 5 and obtained the following results:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that the estimated coefficient transit from negative to positive regardless of the number of spline knots. The following figure visualize the transition for the spline regression with 5 knots, which supports the U-Shaped relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the above checks for U-Shaped relationships, (Haans, Pieters, and He 2016) sgguested the following checks:\n\nThe turning point should be within the range of observations. We can observe that both the turning points above are within the measurement window.\nTheoretical support for the U-shaped relationship. Moderate smartphone use makes users relax and reduces sleep debt. After the turning point, the crowding out effect of screen time and blue light effects dominate the impact of screen time and increases sleep debt.\n\nThe above checks support the U-Shaped relationship in our main specification."

Spline regressions are widely used to test the existence of U- and inverted U-Shaped relationships (Kesavan, Staats, and Gilland 2014; Huang et al. 2023; Tan and Netessine 2019; Xu, Tan, and Netessine 2022; Zou et al. 2023).

There seems not likely to be significant selection bias in terms of sleep quality and smartphone use amount when recruiting students.\nLow"

    "text": "3.2 Dynamic Panel Model\nOne‚Äôs sleep debt today may be influenced by the sleep debt yesterday and even the sleep debt of previous few days. For example, an individual may need to sleep more and reduce phone use to make up sleep today if she/he had significant high sleep debt yesterday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo control for the dynamic endogeneity, we introduce the dynamic panel model by adding the lagged dependent variables:\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, adding lagged dependent variables may introduce extra endogeneity as lagged dependent variables may be correlated with error term(Nickell 1981). To overcome this issue, we apply the Arellano‚ÄìBond estimator, which is a general method of moments (GMM) estimator based on dynamic panel data with first differences (Huang et al. 2023). Arellano‚ÄìBond estimator uses the lagged variables as instruments to address the endogeneity bias. For example, suppose that the sleep debt today is affected by the sleep debt yesterday but not the one of the day before yesterday. In another word, \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-2}\\) only affect \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t}\\) by affecting \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-1}\\). Thus, \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-2}\\) can work as an instrument variable for \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-1}\\), namely ‚Äúinternal instrument‚Äù (Roodman 2009) which is shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation becomes complicated if the \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-2}\\) can directly affect \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t}\\), as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can identify the \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-n}\\) that does not affect \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t}\\) directly and take it as instrument for variables from \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-1}\\) to \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-n-1}\\). The Arellano‚ÄìBond test checks the exogeneity assumption and can tell us whether the lagged variables are correlated with error term. A Sargan test tells us whether the instruments are correctly specified.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arellano‚ÄìBond test above for AR (1) is significant while AR(2) is not, indicating that the lagged one period of sleep debt is a significant estimator for the current sleep debt. We include lagged (1) sleep debt into our main estimation and obtained the following results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArellano-Bond test for AR(1) in first differences:\n\nz = -5.76\np-value = 0.000\nInterpretation: This test checks for the presence of first-order serial correlation. The null hypothesis of no first-order serial correlation is rejected because the p-value is less than 0.05. This suggests that there is first-order serial correlation in the differenced errors, which is expected in first-differenced models.\n\nArellano-Bond test for AR(2) in first differences:\n\nz = 0.53\np-value = 0.594\nInterpretation: This test checks for the presence of second-order serial correlation. The null hypothesis of no second-order serial correlation cannot be rejected because the p-value is greater than 0.05. This suggests that there is no second-order serial correlation in the differenced errors.\n\nSargan test of overidentifying restrictions:\n\nchi2(2) = 45.42\np-value = 0.000\nInterpretation: This test checks the overall validity of the instruments. The null hypothesis is that the instruments are valid (i.e., they are not correlated with the error term). The p-value is less than 0.05, so the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that the instruments may be invalid.\n\nHansen test of overidentifying restrictions:\n\nchi2(2) = 0.00\np-value = 1.000\nInterpretation: Similar to the Sargan test, but robust to heteroskedasticity. The p-value is much greater than 0.05, so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, indicating that the instruments are valid.\n\n\nWe find that one minute increase in the sleep debt of the previous day can lead to 0.095 minute decrease in the current sleep debt. We also observe that the estimation for screen time terms are significant, supporting the existence of U-shaped relationship between sleep debt and screen time.\nThe above process shows how GMM address endogeneity caused by omitted variable. In addition, The GMM model removes other reverse causality by ‚Äúinternally transforming the data‚Äù-taking the first difference of variables in the model(Ullah, Akhtar, and Zaefarian 2018)."

This ‚Äúconvoy‚Äù changes over time in size and composition, adapting to the individual‚Äôs needs and circumstances.\n\nStructure: Each person‚Äôs social network‚Äîtermed a ‚Äúconvoy‚Äù‚Äîconsists of layers of relationships ranging from close, intimate connections (like family and close friends) to more distant and less intense relationships (like acquaintances and colleagues).\nFunction: These social convoys serve various functions, including emotional support (such as love and care), instrumental support (such as help in physical tasks or financial assistance), and informational support (such as advice and guidance).\nChange over Time: The composition and function of these convoys can change over time due to life events, transitions, and aging. For example, the network may expand or contract, and the nature of the support provided might shift as people enter different stages of their life."

While multiple studies show that using social media may cause anxiety for users,. One reason is that individuals tend to selectively post or disclose the best about themselves, which may change other users‚Äô reference points. For example, job candidates may share their offers and packages on social media. However, those who are willing to share the information are usually those above average. This may improve the other individual‚Äôs reference point , decrease their self-efficacy, and increase anxiety. According to social comparison theory, this may impact an individual‚Äôs self-evaluation. Therefore, we conjecture that social media positively improves individuals reference points and increases anxiety levels."

In the meantime, the student‚Äôs sleep debt may increase as he/she spends more time studying on that day.\nBusyness of the next day. The schedule of the next day may impact students‚Äô smartphone use and sleep debt of the previous day. For instance, when students know they have an early class the next day, they may consciously reduce smartphone use and sleep earlier.\nSocial activities at night.¬†Social activities, including parties and dating, may impact both smartphone use and sleep debt. When students have parties scheduled at night, instead of using smartphones, they may spend more time on social activities. Their sleep debt may increase correspondingly due to the\nTiredness of the day.¬†One may reduce smartphone use and sleep earlier and more when he/she feels very tired on that day.\nHealth status of the day. When an individual is sick, she/he may have to reduce smartphone use and spend more time on sleep.\nAccident or emergency.¬†When an individual meets unexpected emergent events, she/he may have to reduce smartphone use. In the meantime, his/her sleep may be deprived.\nTravelling/Flight. Traveling may impact both smartphone use and sleep debt negatively. When an individual is on a flight, his/her access to a smartphone is limited. Also, the individual‚Äôs sleep may be disturbed due to the turbulence during flight.\nChange of lifestyle. When one realizes the harm of smartphone overuse and the importance of healthy sleep, he/she may decide to regulate his/her lifestyle, resulting in less screen time and sleep debt.\nComputer games. Playing computer games may have impacts on both smartphone use and sleep debt. For example, a student who is addicted to computer games may spend less time on a smartphone and sleep.\nFitness at night. Some individuals have the habit of working out in the evening or at night. This lifestyle may reduce screen time before sleep and extend sleep duration, as tiredness may help individuals fall asleep earlier.\nInsomnia. Having insomnia issues may impact both smartphone use and sleep. Individuals may have difficulties in falling asleep when they have insomnia issues. Staying awake may leave individuals time to use their smartphones.\nEntertainment at night. Having entertainment activities at night may impact both smartphone use and sleep debt. For example, one may watch TV and stay up late, resulting in less smartphone use and more sleep debt.\nCaffeine and Alcohol Consumption. These substances can affect sleep quality and are related to lifestyle choices that may correlate with smartphone use habits. For example, drinking alcohol may help individuals fall asleep faster and use less smartphone.\nStress Levels. Overall stress levels can impact both sleep quality and the amount/type of smartphone usage. For instance, when an individual is stressed out due to academic tasks, it may be harder for him/her to fall asleep. In the meantime, the individual may use a smartphone to kill time.\nSocioeconomic Status. This can influence access to smartphones, as well as sleep environments and overall health. For example, students who face financial issues may need to do part-time jobs, which sometimes happens at night (e.g., waiters). This may reduce their smartphone use at night and increase sleep debt.\nMarital Status. Being married or having a partner may influence sleep patterns due to shared sleeping environments and responsibilities that might affect smartphone use before bed.\nChildren in Household. The presence of children, especially young ones, can significantly affect sleep patterns and opportunities for smartphone use.\nRoommate. Having roommates may impact individuals‚Äô smartphone use and sleep cycle. For example, an individual living with roommates may spend more time face-to-face chatting than on a smartphone screen. Moreover, interacting with roommates may impact sleep duration."

In the first five waves of socil surveys, students took the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) test to measure their insomnia level. For the specific questions of the survey,please refer to the questionnaireof PSQI in this link and its references. The PSQI test consists of 19 self-rated questions that generate seven component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of these seven component scores yields one global score. The global score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality. The PSQI test has been widely used in the literature to measure sleep quality and insomnia level. The following figure shows the distribution of individuals‚Äô average PSQI scores of based on the surveys they took.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on PSQI score, a binary PSQIGroup is created to indicate an individual‚Äôs overall sleep quality. When PSQI is &lt;= 5, the student is labeled as ‚ÄòGood Sleep‚Äô, otherwise, the student is labeled as ‚ÄòDisturbed Sleep‚Äô. To test the consistency between Fitbit measured sleep quality and self-reported sleep quality, we compare the sleep debt between the two distinct PSQIGroup groups:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows that ‚ÄòDisturbed Sleep‚Äô group has a 10-minute higher sleep debt than ‚ÄúGood Sleep‚Äù group.\n\n2.2.1 Descriptive Results with Total Observations\nTo evaluate whether our main results are influenced by the potential confounder ‚ÄúInsomnia‚Äù, we conduct the estimation separately for ‚ÄúGood Sleep‚Äù and ‚ÄòDisturbed Sleep‚Äô groups. First, we recall the main descriptive results with total observations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Descriptive Results by PSQIGroup\nNext, we turn to the separate estimations grouped by PSQI level.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue lines in the figures show the sleep debt and orange lines show the message frequency. Lines with circle refer to the ‚ÄòDisturbed Sleep‚Äô group. Lines with square refers to the ‚ÄòGood Sleep‚Äô group. The results suggest that our main estimation results persist in both ‚ÄúGood Sleep‚Äù and ‚ÄòDisturbed Sleep‚Äô groups.\n\n\n2.2.3 Estimation by Insomnia Level\nTo validate the descriptive results above, we run the estimation separately for ‚ÄúGood Sleep‚Äù and ‚ÄòDisturbed Sleep‚Äô groups.\n\n2.2.3.1 Good Sleep Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.2 Disturbed Sleep Group\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimation results for ‚ÄúGood Sleep‚Äù group and ‚ÄúDisturbed Sleep‚Äù group are consistent with our main estimation results with full observations. The turning points of the ‚ÄúDisturbed Sleep‚Äù group are located slightly lefter (81.92 minutes &lt; 83.33 minutes)than those of the ‚ÄúGood Sleep‚Äù group, suggesting that sleep debt of ‚ÄúDisturbed Sleep‚Äù group increases earlier than the ‚ÄúDisturbed Sleep‚Äù group with the increase of screen time.\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Predicted Sleep Debt\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure show the predicted sleep debt for ‚ÄúGood Sleep‚Äù group and ‚ÄúDisturbed Sleep‚Äù group. We observe that the predicted sleep debt of ‚ÄúGood Sleep‚Äù is lower than the ‚ÄúDisturbed Sleep‚Äù group. Both of them show a U-shape relationship between sleep debt and screen time. Overall, we observe that our main findings are not significantly influenced by insomnia.\n\n\n\n2.3 Depression(CES-D)\nDepression might be a confounder for the relation between smartphone use and sleep debt. Evidence suggest that around 75% depressed patients have difficulties falling asleep to some degree(Nutt, Wilson, and Paterson 2008). In this section, we examine whether our main results are influenced by individuals‚Äô depression level. Fortunately, students took standardized depression surveys named Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in the study, which is a screening test for depression and depressive disorder. CES-D measures depress symptoms defined by the American Psychiatric Association‚Äô Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V), this website shows the detail of the scale. The higher the CES-D score, the higher the depression level an individual has. Total Score of 16 or higher is considered depressed, otherwise, it is not depressed. The following figure shows the distribution of participants‚Äô CES-D scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nCES-D depression scale covered survey 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. We check whether sleep debt differ between the depressed group and non-depressed group:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows that ‚ÄúNot Depressed‚Äù group has an average sleep debt of 49.69 minutes, which is 3.5 minutes lower than that of ‚ÄúDepressed‚Äù group.\n\n2.3.1 Descriptive Results by Depression Group\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows how sleep debt change over screen time for individuals with different depress levels. We observe that depressed individuals have an overall higher sleep debt and lower message frequency.\n\n\n2.3.2 Estimation by Depression Level\n\nNot Depressed Group\n\n\n\n\n\nDepressed Group\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Depression (BDI)\nBeck Depression Inventory ÔºàBDI) is another standerdized survey for measuring depression level. The BDI survey was conducted in the second, third, fifth and seventh wave of the study. The BDI survey consists of 21 questions, each with four possible responses ranging from 0 to 3. The total score of the BDI survey ranges from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating higher depression levels. The following figure shows the distribution of participants‚Äô BDI scores. Please refer to the link for the detailed questionnaires.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows the depression levels based on BDI index. [0-13] belongs to minimal depression category, [14-19] refers to mid depression level, [20-28] refers to moderate depression level and [29-63] refers to severe depression level.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe combine mild, moderate and severe categories as depressed group and take minimal level category as non-depressed group. The above figure shows that the depressed group has a higher sleep debt.\n\n2.4.1 Descriptive Results by Depression Group\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows that descriptive trend of sleep debt varying over screen time. It suggests that dethe pressed group has a overall higher sleep debt than the non-depressed group.\n\n\n2.4.2 Predicted Sleep Debt\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above figure show the predicted sleep debt based on two-way fixed effect mdel. The figure shows that depressed group has an overall l higher sleep debt. Woe observe that the Ushape the relationship persists.\n\n\n2.4.3 Estimation by Depression Level\nNot Depresssed Group\n\n\n\n\n\nDepressed Group\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimation results show that the impact of screen time are consistent in not depressed group and depressed group. However, we observe that the impact of message is not significant for depressed group not matter depression is measured by the CESD or BDI.\n\n\n\n2.5 Children at Residential\n\n\n2.6 Socioeconomic Status\nSocioeconomic status could be a confounder for the relationship between smartphone use and sleep debt. For example, students in low-income family may need to do part-time jobs to pay for their student loan debt. In this section, we examine whether our main results are influenced by individuals‚Äô socioeconomic status. Specifically, we use parents‚Äô income level to measure socioeconomic status. The following figure shows the sleep debt varying over participants‚Äô parents‚Äô income level.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that students with parents‚Äô income greater than $250K has 38.66 minutes sleep debt, which is much higher than other categories. While students whose parents‚Äô income are lower than $50K have sleep debts of 53.24 and 66.37 minutes, which are higher than the average. We merge the categories with income less than $50K as low income group, categories with income between $50K~$250K as medium income, and take category with income higher than $250K as high income. The following figure shows sleep debt with three groups:\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we show how sleep debt vary with screen time differentiated by parents‚Äô income level:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that students with low income have a significantly higher sleep debt when screen time is between 10-20 minutes. We speculate that those students may have part-time jobs to do at night, which limit their phone use time and sleep duration. We also observe that students with high household income have a higher message level, indicating that they may spend more time on networking.\n\n2.6.1 Predicted Sleep Debt\n\n\n\nSleep Debt by Parents‚Äô Income Level\n\n\n\n\n2.6.2 Estimation by Household Income Level\n\n2.6.2.1 High Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.2.2 Medium Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6.2.3 Low Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7 Fitbit Work Status During night shift\nWhether Fitbit works during night shift could be a confounder for the relationship between smartphone use and sleep debt. In this section, we examine whether our main results are influenced by individuals‚Äô Fitbit work status during night shift. In the survey, participants were asked whether they wear Fitbit during night shift. The following figure shows the sleep debt varying over participants‚Äô Fitbit work status during night shift: Does Fitbit work a night shift? The following figure shows the sleep debt varying over participants‚Äô Fitbit work status during night shift.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that individuals whose Fitbit work during night shit has a average sleep debt of 55.7 minutes, which is about 5 minutes higher than those whose Fitbit did not work during night shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.1 Estimation by Fitbit Status During Night Shift\n\n2.7.1.1 Not work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.7.1.2 Work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8 Part-time Job\nStudents do part-time job from time to time to pay for their student loan debt or release financial pressure. In the survey, students are asked the following question:\n\n\n\n\n\nDoing part-time could be a confounder for the causal inference between screen time and sleep debt as doing part-time jobs at night could limit individuals‚Äô time spent on screen and sleep.\nTo address the selection issue of part-time job, we first investigate the relationship between sleep debt and the weekly part-time hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that sleep debt increases slightly with the weekly work hours. We then create a dummy variable to further check the results:\n\nWe find that students with part-time jobs have over 6.57 minutes higher sleep debt than students without part-time job. Net we explore how sleep debt vary with screen time for the two groups:\n\nThe above figure suggests that students with part-time jobs have higher sleep debt although both groups represent a U-shaped relationship.\n\n2.8.1 Estimation by Part-Time Job\n\n2.8.1.1 Without Part-Time Job\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8.1.2 With Part-Time Job\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sub-group analysis shows that the estimation results are consistent with our earlier results.\n\n\n\n2.8.2 Predicted Sleep Debt by Part-Time Job\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure above shows that the predicted sleep debt of students without part-time job is significantly lower than that of students with part-time job.\n\n\n\n2.9 Social Network Control\n\n2.9.1 Social Closeness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9.2 Duration Social Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9.3 Centrality of Social Networks\n\n\n2.9.4  Core Number of Social Networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9.5 Trust\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9.6 Social Network Nodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9.7 Social Network Edges\n\n\n\n2.9.8 Control for Social Network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9.9 Control for Social Network(without Structure Features)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.9.10 Subgroup Analysis by Network Features\nWe observe that the group with a long-relationship social network group has less sleep debt than the group with a short-relationship social network, which supports our ‚Äúsocial support‚Äù argument. I also conducted subgroup analysis based on the size, closeness, degree centrality, core number of the social network, however, their prediction curve do not support our ‚Äúsocial support‚Äù argument. In addition, we can also find the difference between different groups reflected by the height of the predicted cure of sleep debt, it is not reflected in when the turning point appears (turning point at 80 minutes or 100 minutes).\n\nSubgroup Analysis by Relationship Length of Social Network\n\nSubgroup Analysis by the Size of Social Network\n\nSubgroup Analysis by the Closeness of Social Network"

    "text": "We thank Dr.Adjerid, Dr.Liu, and Dr.Lowry for your insightful and valuable feedback and for the opportunity to submit a revision. In addition to highlighting the areas that need to be improved, all of you gave detailed suggestions and intensive oral/written instructions I might take to address the concerns. I sincerely appreciate your constructive comments and advice. The manuscript has been substantially revised in response to the review team‚Äôs comments. Below I provide an overview of the main changes.\n\n0.1 [Development of Motivation]\nIn revising the manuscript, we conduct a comprehensive literature review about social engagement, social network activation, and smartphone overuse, through which we can better identify the practical problems and gaps in the previous literature and clarify the contributions of this study. Specifically, we summarize three major practical and research motivations in the area.\n\nPractical problem. The literature on social engagement and smartphone overuse suggests that lack of social engagement can lead to negative health outcomes. A primary consequence of social isolation that is increasingly popular in life but can be easily neglected is smartphone overuse. It is important to examine how to strategically activate social ties so that smartphone users can improve their social engagement level and reduce the excessive time spent on smartphones.\nResearch gaps. The research gaps of the study are reflected in the following aspects:\n\n\nPrevious research on social engagement has largely focused on the volume of social interaction, such as the number of contacts and the frequency of interactions, little attention has been given to the impact of social network structure or topology on an individual‚Äôs behavior and well-being.\nAn equally important, but understudied, aspect of social engagement is dynamic evolutions in engagement with different parts of the social network‚Äì the phenomenon termed social network activation. Most social networks in the current literature possess a static and cross-sectional nature, potentially causing them to overlook the intrinsic dynamics in social interactions. We leverage a longitudinal study to meticulously craft a dynamic social network framework. This innovative approach allows us to meticulously trace the progression of individuals‚Äô social networks over time, capturing the essence of their evolving connections and interactions.\n\nIn addition to the above modification, we introduce and emphasize the technology components in the process of social network activation to make the manuscript fit IS research journals.\n\n\n0.2 [Theorizing and hypothesis development]\nAs suggested by the review team, we conduct a theoretical development for the network features we extracted (degree centrality and K-core), which allows us to develop three hypotheses. Drawing on the three streams of literature on social engagement and smartphone overuse, we first hypothesize that activating social networks reduces smartphone screen time; the reduction in screen time increases with the number of contacts activated (H1). Furthermore, we identify key nodes with high social influence. We infer that contacts with a high degree centrality have a high capacity to motivate social engagement, therefore, our second hypothesis is: Activating social networks with a higher score of average degree centrality in a social network reduces the time spent on a smartphone (H2). Nevertheless, we speculate that degree centrality cannot represent a contact‚Äôs comprehensive influence in a social network as it may neglect a contact‚Äôs indirect influence, which is the capacity to form social groups and mobilize other contacts. Thus, we utilize another essential social network feature, ‚ÄúK-core,‚Äù to measure a contact‚Äôs social influence by considering the connectivity of the contact as well as the cohesiveness of the group in which the contact exists. Therefore, we propose our third hypothesis: Activating social networks with a higher average core number score can reduce the time spent on a smartphone (H3).\n\n\n0.3 [Analysis]\nOur analysis has been improved in several ways. In addition, multiple robustness checks are conducted to validate our estimation results.\n\nWe adjust the threshold of activation. In the first version of this manuscript, the activation threshold is communication event &gt; 0. However, there could be a situation in which the contacts did not respond to the information, which lead to a failed activation. We adjust the activation threshold to ensure a two-way communication (an effective activation) exists between two smartphone users. This eliminates the possibility of one-way communication: one only sends or receives communication information. Overall, the estimation results are mostly consistent with earlier results after the adjustment.\nWe identified smartphone users who are addicted to smartphones. To the best of my knowledge, there is no quantitative definition of smartphone addiction. We define smartphone addiction based on multiple criteria. Finally, we conduct additional robustness checks to rule out alternative explanations and to check reverse causality. All estimation results show that the increase in core number is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of smartphone addiction.\nWe conducted a lookup operation to search for the missing contacts‚Äô social network information from the closest neighbors‚Äô social network surveys. We also conducted an alternative lookup approach by searching for the missing contacts backward first and then forward. In both cases, we borrow the missed contacts‚Äô network features from the closest wave that the contact exists. By doing this, we could have a relatively complete social network.¬† The estimation with an adjusted approach is mostly consistent with earlier estimations.\n\n\n\n0.4 [Writting]\nIn an effort to increase the readability of the paper, we have overhauled the structure and logic of the paper, tightened the analysis, and checked all the grammatical errors and citations.\n\nDr.Idris AdjeridDr.Jiayi Liu\n\n\nThank you for your valuable comments and feedback. Please refer to the manuscript for the writing update.\n\nReview Response for Dr.Idris Adjerid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nComments\nResponses\n\n\n\n\n1\nDoes the analysis differ much with and without this approach, could be better as robustness. Could address the issue of up to date social network.\n\nThank you for your constructive comments. Yes, the analysis with this approach and an alternative approach show similar estimation results. The objective of the approach is to search for the missing contacts‚Äô social network information from the closest neighbors‚Äô social network surveys. This approach starts from a forward lookup followed by a backward lookup for missed contacts in the current wave of social networks. We also conducted an alternative lookup approach by searching for the missing contacts backward first and then forward, which could work as robustness checks.\n\nIn both¬†cases, we borrow the missed contacts‚Äô network features from the closest wave that the contact exists. By doing this, we could have a relatively complete social network.¬† The estimation with an adjusted approach is mostly consistent with earlier estimations:\n\nThe results suggest that an increase in core number could lead to a decrease in screen time, which is consistent with the original estimation.\n\n\n2\n‚Äúdynamic social network‚Äù\nActually this definition is not clear. Social networks can be dynamically measured (i.e.¬†they are repeated snapshots). Would these be dynamic? In reality, you are taking a cross-sectional snapshot of a social network and dynamically measuring activation. You actually do not have dynamic social network data.\nThank you for pointing that out. It sill should be noted that there are two levels of social network features in our study:\n\nIndividual level. Contacts‚Äô original network features come from the social network survey, therefore, they are updated over the waves of surveys.\nCluster/group level. Everyday, participants selectively activate a group of individual contacts. The network features of the activated cluster change day by day.\n\nIt is true that individual‚Äôs social network features evolve survey by survey rather than day by day. Nevertheless, our independent variables are the average social network features of the entire cluster of contacts that are activated on a certain day. Depending on which contacts are activated, the characteristics of the activated cluster change on daily level. For example, if a participant activate the following contacts on day t:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant\nContacts activated\nDate\nK-Core (Individual )\nK-Core (Group)\n\n\n\n\nS\nA\nt\n5\n6\n\n\nS\nB\nt\n6\n6\n\n\nS\nC\nt\n7\n6\n\n\n\nThe K-core for S on day t is (5+6+7)/3=6. On day t+1, the participant activate the following contacts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant\nContacts activated\nDate\nK-Core (Individual )\nK-Core (Group)\n\n\n\n\nS\nC\nt+1\n7\n4\n\n\nS\nE\nt+1\n2\n4\n\n\nS\nH\nt+1\n3\n4\n\n\n\nThe K-core for S on day t+1 is (7+2+3)/3=4. As we can see, the features of contacts A, B, C, E, H does not change in the current wave of survey. However, the feature of the activated cluster comprised of those contacts sill vary day by day.\nIn general, I can feel that the terminology ‚Äúdynamic social network‚Äù could still be controversial or inaccurate, therefore, I have replaced it with ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù in the manuscript for now.\n\n\n3\n‚Äù Moreover, it helps us capture the evolution of one‚Äôs contact list and their position in the network over time, which is the common nature of one‚Äôs social interaction. ‚Äú\nIn some sense, the social network measurement is dynamic both in the evolving structure and the activation. These both need to be highlighted and cleanly separated.\n\n\n\n4\n‚Äúsmartphone addiction‚Äù\nUnless we define this (super clearly it could be confusing, we may want to use another, less loaded term (e.g.¬†‚Äúphone overuse‚Äù\nThanks for your correction, since there is no universal or quantitative definition for smartphone addiction, I have used the term ‚Äúsmartphone overuse‚Äù to substitute ‚Äúsmartphone addiction‚Äù in the manuscript.\n\n\n5\n‚ÄúOur findings reveal that activating contacts who are embraced by the other contacts in one‚Äôs social network helps reduce smartphone use. The findings advance the understanding of social engagement from volume to the structure of social networks.‚Äù\nHow to interpret these results is still unclear, need to have a coherent explanation of results and why these would or would not be expected.\nThanks for your comments. ¬†I modified the statement as follows¬†by adding an explanation of the results:\nOur findings reveal that the topology or structure of one‚Äôs social network impacts individuals‚Äô behavior. Specifically, activating contacts embraced by the community of one‚Äôs social network could motivate broader social engagement, which helps curb smartphone overuse. Our study advances the understanding of social engagement from volume to the structure of social communities.\n\n\n6\n‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we contextualize the research prob- lems in the context of smartphone addiction, which is an emerging social and technical prob- lem and is broadly thought to be associated with the lack of social engagement.‚Äù\nHere there is this argument again. I‚Äôm not sure what we are saying. At points it sounds like we are saying that smartphone addiction is related to social isolation. Alternatively, social isolation could lead to smartphone overuse, both seem credible but the latter is more sensical for our story so we should be clear about this throughout the paper.\nThank you for your comments. The statement has been corrected as:\n‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we narrow down the research questions to smartphone overuse, which is an emerging social and technical problem that is broadly thought to be a consequence of social isolation(Zeng et al. 2022)‚Äù.\n\n\n7\n‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we measure a social network member‚Äôs core number, which measures how well a contact is connected with other contacts and how active the contact‚Äôs community is.‚Äù\nThis is crucial and should be more clearly described. What about centrality? There is a key theoretical construct here which is measured in different ways. So we should identify the key construct and how the two measures we have differ (and by extension setting up why they may different effects).\nThank you for your thorough advice. I think the following theoretical construct could be related to our study:\n\nSocial influence. The construct reflects the capacity of certain nodes in a social network to affect others‚Äô behavior, opinion, and decisions-making process (Izuma 2017). (Social influence. could be a construct for degree centrality and K-Core)\nGroup cohesion. The construct describes to which degree group members are attracted and connected in their group. Group cohesion can be based on shared goals or interests, emotion support, and group pride. Evidence suggests that group cohesion is positively correlated with team performance (Paulus, Kohn, and Dzindolet 2011). (The constructs fits better for K-Core)\n\nI take ‚Äúsocial influence‚Äù as the theoretical construct for now. The statement is modified as follow:\nIn addition to the fundamental network metrics such as size and number of edges, we utilize degree centrality and K-core to identify the vital contacts with high social influence in a network that could have the potential to motivate broader social engagement. The former feature captures the degree to which a contact itself is connected to other contacts. Meanwhile, the latter further considers the connectivity degree of the sub-network to which a contact belongs.\nI wonder if we should identify one theoretical construct for both degree centrality and K-core. Or, should we use two theoretical constructs for degree centrality and K-core separately.\n\n\n8\n‚ÄúHowever, the number of connections of an activated network does not contribute to curbing smartphone use. Moreover, our results suggest that activating contacts in one‚Äôs social network can curb smart- phone use.‚Äù\nThese seem like opposite results, are they? Is the first result suggesting that network size does not have an effect? More generally, I wonder if we should kick things off with the more basic measures and then lead into the new more comprehensive measures. The story is that social networks are rich constructs with some simpler measures (number of nodes, size, etc.) and some more advanced measures that capture richer dynamics. Part of the contribution is leaning into the richer context and using real time data reveal more insight compared to the simple stuff. Need to tell this story more comprehensively.\nThis interpretation is not so clear. Here is the more detailed interpretation of the current results:\nOur results show that activating contacts with high K-core can significantly reduce smartphone overuse time, with a more substantial reduction effect on non-communicative use than communication-driven use. Specifically, one standard deviation increase in core number leads to a 5.7-minute decrease in non-communication screen and a 5.34% decrease in overuse rate. However, activating contacts with a high degree centrality does not help curb smartphone overuse. The distinction between the effects of the two features suggests that contacts with a high K-core, which are those embedded in a cohesive group, have a stronger capability to motivate social engagement and project social influence. Furthermore, we find that the size of an activated social network reduces non-communicative screen time but increases communicative screen time. The two types of effects offset each other and result in no significant impact on overall screen time. The two types of effects offset each other and result in no significant impact on overall screen time. Moreover, we find that the impact of social network features does not vary with mobile communication level. Our results reveal that once a cluster of social networks is activated, the communication level does not influence the impact of the activated cluster, even though the activation itself is based on communication events.\n\n\n9\n‚ÄúThere are generally two types of social isolation: social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. Social disconnectedness refers to the status that someone lacks contacts or social con- nections.‚Äù\nThese are interesting constructs which waiver in their centrality to the story. Do they correlate with our social network measures, are there other measures that capture these distinctions?\nIt is interesting to explore the distinction between social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. In our data, there are three types of perceived loneliness: romantic loneliness, family loneliness and social loneliness. We can use the number of activated contacts per day as a proxy of social disconnectedness. Here is some descriptive results:\nThe correlation between family loneliness and social disconnectedness:\n\n\nThe figure suggests that high family loneliness is correlated with more screen time regardless of the number of contacts activated.\nThe correlation between romantic loneliness and social disconnectedness:\n\n\nThe figure suggests that low romantic loneliness is correlated with high screen time regardless of the number of contacts activated.\nThe correlation between social loneliness and social disconnectedness:\n\n\nThe figure suggests that high social loneliness is correlated with high screen time when participants‚Äô activated contacts are at bottom 20% or top 20%.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your valuable comments and feedback.\n\nReview Response for Dr.Jiayi Liu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nComments\nResponses\n\n\n\n\n1\nIt appears to be that those with higher core-number are mostly close friends. Then one could say that the story is actually much simpler: merely engaging with close friends is what matters. Can you argue for using network features, like core-number, against more intuitive metrics such as contact closeness in this context?\nThank you for your constructive comments. We measured the social distance of smartphone users with their contacts, as well as their level of trust in those contacts, which are the common measurement of interpersonal relationships.\nThe estimation of the above two constructs suggest that they do not have significant impact on participants smartphone use behavior. Please refer to Table 5:\n\n\n\n2\nA fundamental assumption is that social interactions mainly occur through calls and messages. Although the author has presented data showing a link between self-reported interaction levels and observed call/message frequencies, this doesn‚Äôt establish that calls/messages are the primary channels of interaction. People could have spent more time on other social platforms and offline activities (with the time spent also aligning with the self-reported interaction levels). How do you plan to address these potential unobserved interactions? Or can you justify they don‚Äôt affect your results?\nThis is an important issue that we need to address. Thanks for pointing this out. Indeed, there could be unobservable social engagements that are not based on phone call and message: 1) social interactions on other mobile applications; 2) physical interactions that are not based on phone call or messages.\nFirst, for the social interactions happening on other platforms, it is indeed unobservable in our data set. However, based on the market share of the most popular mobile messaging channels, our data covered the leading four channels (Whatsapp, Phone calls, Facebook messager and Texting (SMS):\nTherefore, we suppose that our data has covered the majority of mobile communication activities.\nSecond, in terms of the unobserved offline social interactions, there could be two categories:\n\nSmartphone users‚Äô offline social interactions were initiated by online communication and then it was swithed to offline social interaction. In this situation , the activation of social network is activated by smartphone communication. This scenario could support our 1 & and 2 hypothesis: activating embedded contacts and interacting with them could facilitate offline social engagement.\nThe primary concern is the offline social interaction is independent of smartphone communication. In another word, the activation of social network is not based on smartphone communication. Nevertheless, 67.91% (90134/132709) of our observations are in session, which means students are on campus. For those observations, unobserved social interactions within family are ruled out. We speculate that students started with online social engagement except those with their roommates.\n\n\n\n3\nThe implications from your findings are also not clear. The current results show reduced smartphone use when engaging high ‚Äúcore-number‚Äù contacts. Does this suggest that one should have more interactions with such contacts to minimize their screen time? But the effect seems to be muted for the heaviest smartphone users, meaning this strategy wouldn‚Äôt be effective for those who might be really addicted.\nWe identified smartphone users who are addicted to smartphone. To the best of knowledge, there is no quantitative definition of smartphone addiction. We define smartphone addiction based on multiple criterias:\n\nObservations with daily screen time that are greater than 5 hours (300 minutes).\nObservations with daily screen time that are ranked top 10%, 20%, 30% among population.\nTop 10 % screen time observations for each individuals‚Äô observations.\n\nWe then estimated the probability of addiction with a logit model:\n\\(\\begin{align} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\text { Addiction }_{i t}=1 \\mid \\boldsymbol{X}_{i t}\\right)}{1-\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\text { Addiction }_{i t}=1 \\mid \\boldsymbol{X}_{i t}\\right)}\\right) &= \\nonumber \\\\ &\\quad \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\cdot \\text{Social Network Features}_{it} \\nonumber \\\\ &\\quad+ \\alpha \\cdot X_{it} + \\theta_{i} +\\lambda_{t} + \\varepsilon_{it}\\end{align}\\)\nAll estimation results show that the increase in core number is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of smartphone addiction. For example:\n\n\n\n4\nDoes a single interaction by call/text suffice to trigger this effect?\nCan you provide more thoughts on the results?\nIn the first version of this paper, the activation threshold is communication event &gt; 0. However, there could be a situation that the contacts did not respond to the information, which lead to a failed activation. I adjust it as follows: a contact is activated if any of the two conditions is met:\n1) the communication event type¬†is a Call;\n2) the communication event type is a message (SMS, MMS, or WhatsApp) and there are both ‚Äòoutgoing‚Äù and‚Äôincoming‚Äù messages (SMS, MMS, or WhatsApp).\nThe above two conditions could ensure a¬†two-way¬†communication (an effective activation) exists between two smartphone users.¬†This eliminates the possibility of one-way communication: one only sends or receives¬†communication information. Overall, the estimation results are mostly consistent with earlier results after the adjustment.\n\n\n\n5\nIt could be also interesting to explore how this effect vary by individual‚Äôs perceived loneliness, their social interaction level, or maybe the timing of activation (e.g., morning vs night), etc.\nThe third hypothesis is adjusted as follow:\nAn increase in communication with contacts with a high degree centrality improves the effectiveness of degree centrality in reducing smartphone usage.\n\n\n6\nSmartphone addiction is measured by duration of smartphone use. But certain usages like seeking information or connecting can be productive. Why not consider defining addiction as screentime over a certain threshold?\nPlease refer to response 3.\n\n\n7\n‚ÄúActivation‚Äù of a contact in a social media is determined by a single message or call. Shouldn‚Äôt the frequency of interactions be considered? Would a weighted average make more sense here?\nIn robustness check, we adjust the activtion threshold as two-way communication. Please refer to response 4.\n\n\n8\nIn Figure 5, you handle missing contact information by referencing from the past or future. How often does such missing information happen? Wouldn‚Äôt it be more appropriate to rely on the most recent survey only in order to capture the dynamic relationship?\nWe conducted a lookup operation to search for the missing contacts‚Äô social network information from the closest neighbors‚Äô social network surveys.\n\nWe also conducted an alternative lookup approach by searching for the missing contacts backward first and then forward.\n\nBoth results are consistent with our original analysis:\n\n\n\n9\nFollowing the above point, how did you handle new relationships that emerged between biannual surveys?\nPlease refer to response 8.\n\n\n10\nFigure 7 exemplifies social network activation. I‚Äôm curious about the repeated communications with a few out-of-network contacts: are these inbound or outbound? If these are mostly inbound with no response or occurred at regular times, it might be more reasonable to classify them as potential ads/promotions and exclude them from analysis.\n\nNon-human contacts (promotions, advertising, fishing) are ruled out.\nWe conducted two-way activation threshold to ensure that activation of social network is successful.\n\n\n\n11\nPersonality was included as a control. Shouldn‚Äôt it remain consistent for an individual? If so, you should drop it from the fixed-effect model.\nPersonalities are measured based on social surveys so they could change over surveys. Due to the missing information for certain participants, we excluded the information for now.\n\n\n12\nIt‚Äôs not necessary to write three functions for total, communication, and non-communication screen time; the model is the same.\nThank you, it is corrected in the manuscript.\n\n\n13\nBased on the # observations, the unit of analysis seems to be person-week, but in your model and results, ‚Äút‚Äù indicates day. Please clarify.\nThank you, the structure of the data is individual * day. However, time fixed effect is at the week level (studyweeks), even though our panel data is structured at potentially a more granular (daily) level with date\n\n\n14\nYour hypothesis 3 is about perceived loneliness but the results are missing. ¬†What is the relationship between the perceived loneliness and one‚Äôs actual communication pattern?\nThe third hypothesis is adjusted as follow:\nAn increase in communication with contacts with a high degree centrality improves the effectiveness of degree centrality in reducing smartphone usage.\n\n\n15\nPlease make the tables/figures self-explanatory. For example, in Table 6 it‚Äôs unclear which column corresponds to which subsample. In Table 4, please specify the units for each variable.\nThank you, please refer to the manuscript for the recent correction in formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nIzuma, K. 2017. ‚ÄúThe Neural Bases of Social Influence on Valuation and Behavior.‚Äù In, 199‚Äì209.

    "text": "In this blog, we check our results could be impacted by daylight saving time.Daylight saving time refers to the practice of setting the clocks forward by one hour from standard time during the warmer months of the year, in order to make better use of natural daylight. The practice is used in many European countries, as well as in the United States. The idea is that by moving the clocks forward by one hour, people can enjoy more daylight in the evenings, and this can help to reduce energy consumption and promote outdoor activities. Since the data sets we use are longitudinal studies, we need to consider the impact of daylight saving time on our results. The dates of daylight saving time change in this study are as follows: ‚Äú2015-03-08‚Äù, ‚Äú2015-11-01‚Äù, ‚Äú2016-03-13‚Äù, ‚Äú2016-11-06‚Äù, ‚Äú2017-03-12‚Äù, ‚Äú2017-11-05‚Äù, ‚Äú2018-03-11‚Äù, ‚Äú2018-11-04‚Äù.\n\n0.1 Anomalies Caused by Daylight saving time Change\nThe following table shows the smartphone use activities for egoid ‚Äú79897‚Äù on a daylight saving time change date ‚Äú2016-11-06‚Äù. The measurement window for the day range from 2016-11-05 22:22:00 to 2016-11-06 01:22:00, the observations between the two yellow rows are the those captured by our measurement.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that the clocks are set backward by one hour from daylight saving time to standard time (orange cells). If there were no daylight saving time change, the ending point of the measurement window will be 2016-11-06 02:22:00. In another word, the three-hour measurement window is extended to four hours on this day. However, since the two observations at 1:57 and 1:59 are out of the measurement window, they are not considered in the aggregation process. Therefore, the daylight saving time change caused some anomalies of screen time and unlock.\n\n\n0.2 Impact of Time Adjustment on Sleep\nDue to the clocks change in the Fall and Spring (Spring ForwardÔºåFall Back). Individuals have one hour less sleep on spring change day, and one hour more sleep on fall. Therefore, we may need to drop the observation on those days."

    "text": "In the aggregation of communication events of Paper 1, we only match the communication events with the contacts reported in the current¬†wave of social network surveys. However, the current social network surveys are not¬†enough to cover all the contacts in the communication events. For example, let‚Äôs say an individual communicated with contact C¬†on a day in the spring semester of 2016. However, contact C was not reported in the survey of the 2016 spring; instead, contact C was reported in the survey of the 2015 Fall. Contact C is taken as relation unknown¬†or closeness unknown¬†if we only match communication with the current surveys. In paper 2, we meet the same issue while constructing an individual‚Äôs social networks. We solve it by looking up the missed contacts in a broaden pool of surveys. Specifically, we looking up the missed contacts in: 1) complete¬†social network surveys in which the focal person participated; or, 2) surveys with limitations to the closest N¬†neighboring waves. In this example, we can identify contact C‚Äôs social relationship and closeness in the survey of the fall of 2015.\nIn this update, we applied a similar look-up strategy for Paper 1. By doing this, the communication events from closeness unknown contacts and relationship unknown contacts decreased. In contrast, those from identified contacts increased. The following figures illustrate a comparison of the proportions of communication categories with different look-up strategies."

A failure to reject the null hypothesis would indicate that the instruments are not relevant, and hence the model is underidentified (meaning the IV approach cannot be validly used).\nIn the results, the Kleibergen-Paap rk LM statistic is 105.271 with a p-value of 0.0000, indicating strong rejection of the null hypothesis of underidentification. This means the instruments are likely relevant.\n\nWeak Identification Tests (Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic and Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F statistic):\n\nThese tests check whether the instruments are sufficiently correlated with the endogenous regressors. While the instruments may be correlated (not underidentified), they might not be strong enough to provide reliable estimates (weak instruments).\nThe critical values provided by Stock and Yogo help determine whether the instruments are weak. If the test statistic (Cragg-Donald or Kleibergen-Paap) is above the critical value for a given maximal IV size (size of a test for a given level of IV bias), the instruments are not considered weak.\nIn the case, the Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic is 57.995, and the Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F statistic is 52.396. These are both above the highest listed Stock-Yogo critical value of 7.03 for a maximal IV size of 10%. This indicates that the instrument is not weak according to the Stock-Yogo weak identification test standards.\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nThe underidentification test indicates that the model is properly identified, meaning that there is a statistical relationship between the instruments and the endogenous variables.\nThe weak identification tests suggest that the instruments are strong, as indicated by the test statistics significantly exceeding the Stock-Yogo critical values.\n\nTherefore, based on these diagnostics, it appears that the instrument (battery levels) is both relevant (related to the endogenous variable screen time) and strong (provides sufficient information to estimate the causal effect reliably). This lends credibility to the IV estimates obtained from the model. However, remember that these tests do not address other potential issues such as exogeneity (whether the instruments are correlated with the error term) and overidentification (having more instruments than endogenous variables, which can be tested with a different set of tests). Always consider the theoretical justification for the instruments in addition to these statistical tests.\n\n\n2.2.3 Battery IV with Turning Point\n\n2.2.3.1 IV Before Turning Point\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.2 IV After Turning Point"

We conjecture that activating contacts with high core number reduces screen time by increasing individuals‚Äô daily steps. We examine our conjecture by conducting a mediation analysis. The descriptive statistics of the IV(Total core number), mediator(steps) and DV( Screen time) is as follow:\n\n\n2.1 Sobel-Goodman Mediation Tests\n(Two-Way Activation Threshold with Borrowing Limitation to Closest 1 Neighbor)\nsgmediation2 unlock_time, iv(tcore) mv(steps) cv(degree_centrality inactive_nodes out_contacts num_edges \nminsasleep trust close position duration in_com out_com duration2 community  naps nap_minsasleep \ni.insession i.weekday i.studyweek i.egoid)\n\n\n\n\n\n\na_coefficient: impact of total core number on steps (100 steps)\nb_coefficient: impact of steps on screen time (min)\nIndirect_effect_aXb: a_coefficient ‚®â b_coefficient, which is the impact of core number on screen time through steps\nDirect_effect_c‚Äô: impact of total core number on screen time\nTotal_effect_c: Indirect_effect_aXb + Direct_effect_c‚Äô, which is the total effect of total core number on screen time\n\n\nHere we use total core number as our main independent variable, which is the product of activated contacts ‚®â core number of each activated contacts. The results suggest that one unit increase in total core number lead to a 16-step (0.16‚®â100) increase in daily steps. Evey one hundred steps increase is associated with 0.19 minute decrease in screen time. Therefore, one unit increase in total core number is indirectly associated with 0.03 (0.16‚®â0.19) minute decrease in screen time. In the meanwhile, one unit increase in total core number is directly associated with 0.163 minute decrease in screen time. Overall, one unit increase of total core number is associated with 0.193 minute decrease in screen time, in which 15.8% of the effects is through the channel of daily steps.\nNotes: The mediation effect of steps is not significant when average ‚ÄôCore number‚Äù work as IV"

For example, the maximum value of sleep debt is about 8 hours (479 minutes), suggesting that one did not sleep at all on that day. The minimal value of sleep debt is -12.96 hours (-778 minutes), suggesting that one slept for 20.96 hours, which is quite unusual. Moreover, the maximum screen time is 179.99 minutes; the maximum message is 1015 and the maximum unlock actions is 817 times, which could barely happen.\nRecall the model-free analysis about the relationship among sleep debt, screen time and message:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe margins plot based on fixed effect model with the above data is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the existence of outliers, the upwarding part of the U-shape might be caused by the outliers at the tail (the rightmost few bars). To check whether the U-shaped relationship is caused by outliers, we reviewed the literature about the treatement of outliers and identified the following outlier treatment strategies: winsorization, trimming, and interquartile range method (Leone, Minutti-Meza, and Wasley 2019; Mitton 2022; Vinutha, Poornima, and Sagar 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinsorization replaces the extreme values with values at certain quartile cutoffs. The most commonly used cutoffs in business research is 1st and 99th percentiles, 5th/95th and 10th/90th are used as well (Mitton 2022). We winsorize the continuous variables in our specification at cutoffs of 1st/99tth, 2.5th/97.5th, 5th/95th and 10th/90th. The following table shows the descriptive statistics after winsorization at cutoffs of 5th/95th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsleep_debt\nscreen_time\nunlock\nmessage\n\n\n\n\ncount\n114762.00\n114762.00\n114762.00\n114762.00\n\n\nmean\n50.29\n38.05\n13.20\n17.25\n\n\nstd\n87.52\n35.33\n11.44\n26.84\n\n\nmin\n-110.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\n25%\n-11.00\n8.23\n4.00\n0.00\n\n\n50%\n48.00\n29.23\n11.00\n3.00\n\n\n75%\n110.00\n58.32\n20.00\n23.00\n\n\nmax\n222.00\n120.68\n40.00\n95.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can find that range of sleep debt changes to [-111, 224] minutes from [-778, 479] minutes; the maximum screen time decreased to 121.46 minutes from 179.99 minutes; the maximum unlock decreased to 40 from 817; the maximum message decreased to 95 from 1015, which are relatively normal. The following table shows the descriptive statistics with winsorization at cutoffs of 1st/99tth, 2.5th/97.5th, 5th/95th and 10th/90th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrimming deals with the outliers by simply dropping the observations with extreme values. Different from winsorization, trimming reduces the number of observations. We trim the data based on screen time at cutoffs of 1st/99tth, 2.5th/97.5th, 5th/95th and 10th/90th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR) method is a variable rank strategy that rules out the outliers by calculating the upper and lower fence based on quartile values (link).\n\nInterquartile Range (IQR)=Q3-Q1\nUpper fence = Q3+1.5√óIQR\nLower fence = Q1-1.5√óIQR\n\nRecall the descriptive statistics of raw data, the IQR for screen time = Q3-Q1 = 58.32 - 8.23 = 50.09 minutes. Thus, the upper and lower fences for screen time are calculated as:\n\nUpper fence = 58.32+1.5√ó50.09 = 133.455 minutes\nLower fence = 8.23-1.5√ó50.09 = -66.891 minutes\n\nConsidering that screen time should a non-negative value, the range for screen time is [0, 133. 455] minutes. The descriptive statistics for the main variables are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsleep_debt\nscreen_time\nunlock\nmessage\n\n\n\n\ncount\n111176.00\n111176.00\n111176.00\n111176.00\n\n\nmean\n48.42\n39.33\n13.97\n20.65\n\n\nstd\n88.30\n38.56\n14.29\n41.92\n\n\nmin\n-192.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\n25%\n-10.00\n8.40\n4.00\n0.00\n\n\n50%\n47.00\n29.35\n11.00\n3.00\n\n\n75%\n106.00\n58.37\n20.00\n23.00\n\n\nmax\n291.00\n179.99\n817.00\n1015.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then estimate the sleep debt based on the data after winsorization, trimming and IQR method with the fixed effect model.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated coefficients for screen time and its quadratic terms are significant suggesting that the existence of turning points. The following figure visualize the margin plot based on the above outlier treatment strategies:\n\nThe margins plot supports the existence of U-shaped relationship and the turning point are within the range of measurement windows (180 minutes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpline regressions estimate the coefficients of screen time on sleep debt piecewisely. Spline regressions are widely used to test the existence of U- and inverted U-Shaped relationships (Kesavan, Staats, and Gilland 2014; Huang et al. 2023; Tan and Netessine 2019; Xu, Tan, and Netessine 2022; Zou et al. 2023). For example, the following equation estimated the coefficients with 4 knots.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe vary the number of knots from 1 to 5 and obtained the following results:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that the estimated coefficient transit from negative to positive regardless of the number of spline knots. The following figure visualize the transition for the spline regression with 5 knots, which supports the U-Shaped relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the above checks for U-Shaped relationships, (Haans, Pieters, and He 2016) sgguested the following checks:\n\nThe turning point should be within the range of observations. We can observe that both the turning points above are within the measurement window.\nTheoretical support for the U-shaped relationship. Moderate smartphone use makes users relax and reduces sleep debt. After the turning point, the crowding out effect of screen time and blue light effects dominate the impact of screen time and increases sleep debt.\n\nThe above checks support the U-Shaped relationship in our main specification."

For example, the maximum value of sleep debt is about 8 hours (479 minutes), suggesting that one did not sleep at all on that day. The minimal value of sleep debt is -12.96 hours (-778 minutes), suggesting that one slept for 20.96 hours, which is quite unusual. Moreover, the maximum screen time is 179.99 minutes; the maximum message is 1015 and the maximum unlock actions is 817 times, which could barely happen.\nRecall the model-free analysis about the relationship among sleep debt, screen time and message:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe margins plot based on fixed effect model with the above data is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the existence of outliers, the upwarding part of the U-shape might be caused by the outliers at the tail (the rightmost few bars). To check whether the U-shaped relationship is caused by outliers, we reviewed the literature about the treatement of outliers and identified the following outlier treatment strategies: winsorization, trimming, and interquartile range method (Leone, Minutti-Meza, and Wasley 2019; Mitton 2022; Vinutha, Poornima, and Sagar 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinsorization replaces the extreme values with values at certain quartile cutoffs. The most commonly used cutoffs in business research is 1st and 99th percentiles, 5th/95th and 10th/90th are used as well (Mitton 2022). We winsorize the continuous variables in our specification at cutoffs of 1st/99tth, 2.5th/97.5th, 5th/95th and 10th/90th. The following table shows the descriptive statistics after winsorization at cutoffs of 5th/95th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsleep_debt\nscreen_time\nunlock\nmessage\n\n\n\n\ncount\n114762.00\n114762.00\n114762.00\n114762.00\n\n\nmean\n50.29\n38.05\n13.20\n17.25\n\n\nstd\n87.52\n35.33\n11.44\n26.84\n\n\nmin\n-110.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\n25%\n-11.00\n8.23\n4.00\n0.00\n\n\n50%\n48.00\n29.23\n11.00\n3.00\n\n\n75%\n110.00\n58.32\n20.00\n23.00\n\n\nmax\n222.00\n120.68\n40.00\n95.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can find that range of sleep debt changes to [-111, 224] minutes from [-778, 479] minutes; the maximum screen time decreased to 121.46 minutes from 179.99 minutes; the maximum unlock decreased to 40 from 817; the maximum message decreased to 95 from 1015, which are relatively normal. The following table shows the descriptive statistics with winsorization at cutoffs of 1st/99tth, 2.5th/97.5th, 5th/95th and 10th/90th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrimming deals with the outliers by simply dropping the observations with extreme values. Different from winsorization, trimming reduces the number of observations. We trim the data based on screen time at cutoffs of 1st/99tth, 2.5th/97.5th, 5th/95th and 10th/90th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR) method is a variable rank strategy that rules out the outliers by calculating the upper and lower fence based on quartile values (link).\n\nInterquartile Range (IQR)=Q3-Q1\nUpper fence = Q3+1.5√óIQR\nLower fence = Q1-1.5√óIQR\n\nRecall the descriptive statistics of raw data, the IQR for screen time = Q3-Q1 = 58.32 - 8.23 = 50.09 minutes. Thus, the upper and lower fences for screen time are calculated as:\n\nUpper fence = 58.32+1.5√ó50.09 = 133.455 minutes\nLower fence = 8.23-1.5√ó50.09 = -66.891 minutes\n\nConsidering that screen time should a non-negative value, the range for screen time is [0, 133. 455] minutes.

    "text": "3.2 Dynamic Panel Model\nOne‚Äôs sleep debt today may be influenced by the sleep debt yesterday and even the sleep debt of previous few days. For example, an individual may need to sleep more and reduce phone use to make up sleep today if she/he had significant high sleep debt yesterday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo control for the dynamic endogeneity, we introduce the dynamic panel model by adding the lagged dependent variables:\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, adding lagged dependent variables may introduce extra endogeneity as lagged dependent variables may be correlated with error term(Nickell 1981). To overcome this issue, we apply the Arellano‚ÄìBond estimator, which is a general method of moments (GMM) estimator based on dynamic panel data with first differences (Huang et al. 2023). Arellano‚ÄìBond estimator uses the lagged variables as instruments to address the endogeneity bias. For example, suppose that the sleep debt today is affected by the sleep debt yesterday but not the one of the day before yesterday. In another word, \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-2}\\) only affect \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t}\\) by affecting \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-1}\\). Thus, \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-2}\\) can work as an instrument variable for \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-1}\\), namely ‚Äúinternal instrument‚Äù (Roodman 2009) which is shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation becomes complicated if the \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-2}\\) can directly affect \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t}\\), as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can identify the \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-n}\\) that does not affect \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t}\\) directly and take it as instrument for variables from \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-1}\\) to \\(Sleep\\ Debt_{i,t-n-1}\\). The Arellano‚ÄìBond test checks the exogeneity assumption and can tell us whether the lagged variables are correlated with error term. A Sargan test tells us whether the instruments are correctly specified.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arellano‚ÄìBond test above for AR (1) is significant while AR(2) is not, indicating that the lagged one period of sleep debt is a significant estimator for the current sleep debt. We include lagged (1) sleep debt into our main estimation and obtained the following results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArellano-Bond test for AR(1) in first differences:\n\nz = -5.76\np-value = 0.000\nInterpretation: This test checks for the presence of first-order serial correlation. The null hypothesis of no first-order serial correlation is rejected because the p-value is less than 0.05. This suggests that there is first-order serial correlation in the differenced errors, which is expected in first-differenced models.\n\nArellano-Bond test for AR(2) in first differences:\n\nz = 0.53\np-value = 0.594\nInterpretation: This test checks for the presence of second-order serial correlation. The null hypothesis of no second-order serial correlation cannot be rejected because the p-value is greater than 0.05. This suggests that there is no second-order serial correlation in the differenced errors.\n\nSargan test of overidentifying restrictions:\n\nchi2(2) = 45.42\np-value = 0.000\nInterpretation: This test checks the overall validity of the instruments. The null hypothesis is that the instruments are valid (i.e., they are not correlated with the error term). The p-value is less than 0.05, so the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that the instruments may be invalid.\n\nHansen test of overidentifying restrictions:\n\nchi2(2) = 0.00\np-value = 1.000\nInterpretation: Similar to the Sargan test, but robust to heteroskedasticity. The p-value is much greater than 0.05, so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, indicating that the instruments are valid.\n\n\nWe find that one minute increase in the sleep debt of the previous day can lead to 0.095 minute decrease in the current sleep debt. We also observe that the estimation for screen time terms are significant, supporting the existence of U-shaped relationship between sleep debt and screen time.\nThe above process shows how GMM address endogeneity caused by omitted variable. In addition, The GMM model removes other reverse causality by ‚Äúinternally transforming the data‚Äù-taking the first difference of variables in the model(Ullah, Akhtar, and Zaefarian 2018)."

A failure to reject the null hypothesis would indicate that the instruments are not relevant, and hence the model is underidentified (meaning the IV approach cannot be validly used).\nIn the results, the Kleibergen-Paap rk LM statistic is 105.271 with a p-value of 0.0000, indicating strong rejection of the null hypothesis of underidentification. This means the instruments are likely relevant.\n\nWeak Identification Tests (Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic and Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F statistic):\n\nThese tests check whether the instruments are sufficiently correlated with the endogenous regressors. While the instruments may be correlated (not underidentified), they might not be strong enough to provide reliable estimates (weak instruments).\nThe critical values provided by Stock and Yogo help determine whether the instruments are weak. If the test statistic (Cragg-Donald or Kleibergen-Paap) is above the critical value for a given maximal IV size (size of a test for a given level of IV bias), the instruments are not considered weak.\nIn the case, the Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic is 57.995, and the Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F statistic is 52.396. These are both above the highest listed Stock-Yogo critical value of 7.03 for a maximal IV size of 10%. This indicates that the instrument is not weak according to the Stock-Yogo weak identification test standards.\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nThe underidentification test indicates that the model is properly identified, meaning that there is a statistical relationship between the instruments and the endogenous variables.\nThe weak identification tests suggest that the instruments are strong, as indicated by the test statistics significantly exceeding the Stock-Yogo critical values.\n\nTherefore, based on these diagnostics, it appears that the instrument (battery levels) is both relevant (related to the endogenous variable screen time) and strong (provides sufficient information to estimate the causal effect reliably). This lends credibility to the IV estimates obtained from the model. However, remember that these tests do not address other potential issues such as exogeneity (whether the instruments are correlated with the error term) and overidentification (having more instruments than endogenous variables, which can be tested with a different set of tests). Always consider the theoretical justification for the instruments in addition to these statistical tests.\n\n\n2.2.3 Battery IV with Turning Point\n\n2.2.3.1 IV Before Turning Point\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.2 IV After Turning Point"

    "text": "We thank Dr.Adjerid, Dr.Liu, and Dr.Lowry for your insightful and valuable feedback and for the opportunity to submit a revision. In addition to highlighting the areas that need to be improved, all of you gave detailed suggestions and intensive oral/written instructions I might take to address the concerns. I sincerely appreciate your constructive comments and advice. The manuscript has been substantially revised in response to the review team‚Äôs comments. Below I provide an overview of the main changes.\n\n0.1 [Development of Motivation]\nIn revising the manuscript, we conduct a comprehensive literature review about social engagement, social network activation, and smartphone overuse, through which we can better identify the practical problems and gaps in the previous literature and clarify the contributions of this study. Specifically, we summarize three major practical and research motivations in the area.\n\nPractical problem. The literature on social engagement and smartphone overuse suggests that lack of social engagement can lead to negative health outcomes. A primary consequence of social isolation that is increasingly popular in life but can be easily neglected is smartphone overuse. It is important to examine how to strategically activate social ties so that smartphone users can improve their social engagement level and reduce the excessive time spent on smartphones.\nResearch gaps. The research gaps of the study are reflected in the following aspects:\n\n\nPrevious research on social engagement has largely focused on the volume of social interaction, such as the number of contacts and the frequency of interactions, little attention has been given to the impact of social network structure or topology on an individual‚Äôs behavior and well-being.\nAn equally important, but understudied, aspect of social engagement is dynamic evolutions in engagement with different parts of the social network‚Äì the phenomenon termed social network activation. Most social networks in the current literature possess a static and cross-sectional nature, potentially causing them to overlook the intrinsic dynamics in social interactions. We leverage a longitudinal study to meticulously craft a dynamic social network framework. This innovative approach allows us to meticulously trace the progression of individuals‚Äô social networks over time, capturing the essence of their evolving connections and interactions.\n\nIn addition to the above modification, we introduce and emphasize the technology components in the process of social network activation to make the manuscript fit IS research journals.\n\n\n0.2 [Theorizing and hypothesis development]\nAs suggested by the review team, we conduct a theoretical development for the network features we extracted (degree centrality and K-core), which allows us to develop three hypotheses. Drawing on the three streams of literature on social engagement and smartphone overuse, we first hypothesize that activating social networks reduces smartphone screen time; the reduction in screen time increases with the number of contacts activated (H1). Furthermore, we identify key nodes with high social influence. We infer that contacts with a high degree centrality have a high capacity to motivate social engagement, therefore, our second hypothesis is: Activating social networks with a higher score of average degree centrality in a social network reduces the time spent on a smartphone (H2). Nevertheless, we speculate that degree centrality cannot represent a contact‚Äôs comprehensive influence in a social network as it may neglect a contact‚Äôs indirect influence, which is the capacity to form social groups and mobilize other contacts. Thus, we utilize another essential social network feature, ‚ÄúK-core,‚Äù to measure a contact‚Äôs social influence by considering the connectivity of the contact as well as the cohesiveness of the group in which the contact exists. Therefore, we propose our third hypothesis: Activating social networks with a higher average core number score can reduce the time spent on a smartphone (H3).\n\n\n0.3 [Analysis]\nOur analysis has been improved in several ways. In addition, multiple robustness checks are conducted to validate our estimation results.\n\nWe adjust the threshold of activation. In the first version of this manuscript, the activation threshold is communication event &gt; 0. However, there could be a situation in which the contacts did not respond to the information, which lead to a failed activation. We adjust the activation threshold to ensure a two-way communication (an effective activation) exists between two smartphone users. This eliminates the possibility of one-way communication: one only sends or receives communication information. Overall, the estimation results are mostly consistent with earlier results after the adjustment.\nWe identified smartphone users who are addicted to smartphones. To the best of my knowledge, there is no quantitative definition of smartphone addiction. We define smartphone addiction based on multiple criteria. Finally, we conduct additional robustness checks to rule out alternative explanations and to check reverse causality. All estimation results show that the increase in core number is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of smartphone addiction.\nWe conducted a lookup operation to search for the missing contacts‚Äô social network information from the closest neighbors‚Äô social network surveys. We also conducted an alternative lookup approach by searching for the missing contacts backward first and then forward. In both cases, we borrow the missed contacts‚Äô network features from the closest wave that the contact exists. By doing this, we could have a relatively complete social network.¬† The estimation with an adjusted approach is mostly consistent with earlier estimations.\n\n\n\n0.4 [Writting]\nIn an effort to increase the readability of the paper, we have overhauled the structure and logic of the paper, tightened the analysis, and checked all the grammatical errors and citations.\n\nDr.Idris AdjeridDr.Jiayi Liu\n\n\nThank you for your valuable comments and feedback. Please refer to the manuscript for the writing update.\n\nReview Response for Dr.Idris Adjerid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nComments\nResponses\n\n\n\n\n1\nDoes the analysis differ much with and without this approach, could be better as robustness. Could address the issue of up to date social network.\n\nThank you for your constructive comments. Yes, the analysis with this approach and an alternative approach show similar estimation results. The objective of the approach is to search for the missing contacts‚Äô social network information from the closest neighbors‚Äô social network surveys. This approach starts from a forward lookup followed by a backward lookup for missed contacts in the current wave of social networks. We also conducted an alternative lookup approach by searching for the missing contacts backward first and then forward, which could work as robustness checks.\n\nIn both¬†cases, we borrow the missed contacts‚Äô network features from the closest wave that the contact exists. By doing this, we could have a relatively complete social network.¬† The estimation with an adjusted approach is mostly consistent with earlier estimations:\n\nThe results suggest that an increase in core number could lead to a decrease in screen time, which is consistent with the original estimation.\n\n\n2\n‚Äúdynamic social network‚Äù\nActually this definition is not clear. Social networks can be dynamically measured (i.e.¬†they are repeated snapshots). Would these be dynamic? In reality, you are taking a cross-sectional snapshot of a social network and dynamically measuring activation. You actually do not have dynamic social network data.\nThank you for pointing that out. It sill should be noted that there are two levels of social network features in our study:\n\nIndividual level. Contacts‚Äô original network features come from the social network survey, therefore, they are updated over the waves of surveys.\nCluster/group level. Everyday, participants selectively activate a group of individual contacts. The network features of the activated cluster change day by day.\n\nIt is true that individual‚Äôs social network features evolve survey by survey rather than day by day. Nevertheless, our independent variables are the average social network features of the entire cluster of contacts that are activated on a certain day. Depending on which contacts are activated, the characteristics of the activated cluster change on daily level. For example, if a participant activate the following contacts on day t:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant\nContacts activated\nDate\nK-Core (Individual )\nK-Core (Group)\n\n\n\n\nS\nA\nt\n5\n6\n\n\nS\nB\nt\n6\n6\n\n\nS\nC\nt\n7\n6\n\n\n\nThe K-core for S on day t is (5+6+7)/3=6. On day t+1, the participant activate the following contacts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant\nContacts activated\nDate\nK-Core (Individual )\nK-Core (Group)\n\n\n\n\nS\nC\nt+1\n7\n4\n\n\nS\nE\nt+1\n2\n4\n\n\nS\nH\nt+1\n3\n4\n\n\n\nThe K-core for S on day t+1 is (7+2+3)/3=4. As we can see, the features of contacts A, B, C, E, H does not change in the current wave of survey. However, the feature of the activated cluster comprised of those contacts sill vary day by day.\nIn general, I can feel that the terminology ‚Äúdynamic social network‚Äù could still be controversial or inaccurate, therefore, I have replaced it with ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù in the manuscript for now.\n\n\n3\n‚Äù Moreover, it helps us capture the evolution of one‚Äôs contact list and their position in the network over time, which is the common nature of one‚Äôs social interaction. ‚Äú\nIn some sense, the social network measurement is dynamic both in the evolving structure and the activation. These both need to be highlighted and cleanly separated.\n\n\n\n4\n‚Äúsmartphone addiction‚Äù\nUnless we define this (super clearly it could be confusing, we may want to use another, less loaded term (e.g.¬†‚Äúphone overuse‚Äù\nThanks for your correction, since there is no universal or quantitative definition for smartphone addiction, I have used the term ‚Äúsmartphone overuse‚Äù to substitute ‚Äúsmartphone addiction‚Äù in the manuscript.\n\n\n5\n‚ÄúOur findings reveal that activating contacts who are embraced by the other contacts in one‚Äôs social network helps reduce smartphone use. The findings advance the understanding of social engagement from volume to the structure of social networks.‚Äù\nHow to interpret these results is still unclear, need to have a coherent explanation of results and why these would or would not be expected.\nThanks for your comments. ¬†I modified the statement as follows¬†by adding an explanation of the results:\nOur findings reveal that the topology or structure of one‚Äôs social network impacts individuals‚Äô behavior. Specifically, activating contacts embraced by the community of one‚Äôs social network could motivate broader social engagement, which helps curb smartphone overuse. Our study advances the understanding of social engagement from volume to the structure of social communities.\n\n\n6\n‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we contextualize the research prob- lems in the context of smartphone addiction, which is an emerging social and technical prob- lem and is broadly thought to be associated with the lack of social engagement.‚Äù\nHere there is this argument again. I‚Äôm not sure what we are saying. At points it sounds like we are saying that smartphone addiction is related to social isolation. Alternatively, social isolation could lead to smartphone overuse, both seem credible but the latter is more sensical for our story so we should be clear about this throughout the paper.\nThank you for your comments. The statement has been corrected as:\n‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we narrow down the research questions to smartphone overuse, which is an emerging social and technical problem that is broadly thought to be a consequence of social isolation(Zeng et al. 2022)‚Äù.\n\n\n7\n‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶we measure a social network member‚Äôs core number, which measures how well a contact is connected with other contacts and how active the contact‚Äôs community is.‚Äù\nThis is crucial and should be more clearly described. What about centrality? There is a key theoretical construct here which is measured in different ways. So we should identify the key construct and how the two measures we have differ (and by extension setting up why they may different effects).\nThank you for your thorough advice. I think the following theoretical construct could be related to our study:\n\nSocial influence. The construct reflects the capacity of certain nodes in a social network to affect others‚Äô behavior, opinion, and decisions-making process (Izuma 2017). (Social influence. could be a construct for degree centrality and K-Core)\nGroup cohesion. The construct describes to which degree group members are attracted and connected in their group. Group cohesion can be based on shared goals or interests, emotion support, and group pride. Evidence suggests that group cohesion is positively correlated with team performance (Paulus, Kohn, and Dzindolet 2011). (The constructs fits better for K-Core)\n\nI take ‚Äúsocial influence‚Äù as the theoretical construct for now. The statement is modified as follow:\nIn addition to the fundamental network metrics such as size and number of edges, we utilize degree centrality and K-core to identify the vital contacts with high social influence in a network that could have the potential to motivate broader social engagement. The former feature captures the degree to which a contact itself is connected to other contacts. Meanwhile, the latter further considers the connectivity degree of the sub-network to which a contact belongs.\nI wonder if we should identify one theoretical construct for both degree centrality and K-core. Or, should we use two theoretical constructs for degree centrality and K-core separately.\n\n\n8\n‚ÄúHowever, the number of connections of an activated network does not contribute to curbing smartphone use. Moreover, our results suggest that activating contacts in one‚Äôs social network can curb smart- phone use.‚Äù\nThese seem like opposite results, are they? Is the first result suggesting that network size does not have an effect? More generally, I wonder if we should kick things off with the more basic measures and then lead into the new more comprehensive measures. The story is that social networks are rich constructs with some simpler measures (number of nodes, size, etc.) and some more advanced measures that capture richer dynamics. Part of the contribution is leaning into the richer context and using real time data reveal more insight compared to the simple stuff. Need to tell this story more comprehensively.\nThis interpretation is not so clear. Here is the more detailed interpretation of the current results:\nOur results show that activating contacts with high K-core can significantly reduce smartphone overuse time, with a more substantial reduction effect on non-communicative use than communication-driven use. Specifically, one standard deviation increase in core number leads to a 5.7-minute decrease in non-communication screen and a 5.34% decrease in overuse rate. However, activating contacts with a high degree centrality does not help curb smartphone overuse. The distinction between the effects of the two features suggests that contacts with a high K-core, which are those embedded in a cohesive group, have a stronger capability to motivate social engagement and project social influence. Furthermore, we find that the size of an activated social network reduces non-communicative screen time but increases communicative screen time. The two types of effects offset each other and result in no significant impact on overall screen time. The two types of effects offset each other and result in no significant impact on overall screen time. Moreover, we find that the impact of social network features does not vary with mobile communication level. Our results reveal that once a cluster of social networks is activated, the communication level does not influence the impact of the activated cluster, even though the activation itself is based on communication events.\n\n\n9\n‚ÄúThere are generally two types of social isolation: social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. Social disconnectedness refers to the status that someone lacks contacts or social con- nections.‚Äù\nThese are interesting constructs which waiver in their centrality to the story. Do they correlate with our social network measures, are there other measures that capture these distinctions?\nIt is interesting to explore the distinction between social disconnectedness and perceived isolation. In our data, there are three types of perceived loneliness: romantic loneliness, family loneliness and social loneliness. We can use the number of activated contacts per day as a proxy of social disconnectedness. Here is some descriptive results:\nThe correlation between family loneliness and social disconnectedness:\n\n\nThe figure suggests that high family loneliness is correlated with more screen time regardless of the number of contacts activated.\nThe correlation between romantic loneliness and social disconnectedness:\n\n\nThe figure suggests that low romantic loneliness is correlated with high screen time regardless of the number of contacts activated.\nThe correlation between social loneliness and social disconnectedness:\n\n\nThe figure suggests that high social loneliness is correlated with high screen time when participants‚Äô activated contacts are at bottom 20% or top 20%.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your valuable comments and feedback.\n\nReview Response for Dr.Jiayi Liu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nComments\nResponses\n\n\n\n\n1\nIt appears to be that those with higher core-number are mostly close friends. Then one could say that the story is actually much simpler: merely engaging with close friends is what matters. Can you argue for using network features, like core-number, against more intuitive metrics such as contact closeness in this context?\nThank you for your constructive comments. We measured the social distance of smartphone users with their contacts, as well as their level of trust in those contacts, which are the common measurement of interpersonal relationships.\nThe estimation of the above two constructs suggest that they do not have significant impact on participants smartphone use behavior. Please refer to Table 5:\n\n\n\n2\nA fundamental assumption is that social interactions mainly occur through calls and messages. Although the author has presented data showing a link between self-reported interaction levels and observed call/message frequencies, this doesn‚Äôt establish that calls/messages are the primary channels of interaction. People could have spent more time on other social platforms and offline activities (with the time spent also aligning with the self-reported interaction levels). How do you plan to address these potential unobserved interactions? Or can you justify they don‚Äôt affect your results?\nThis is an important issue that we need to address. Thanks for pointing this out. Indeed, there could be unobservable social engagements that are not based on phone call and message: 1) social interactions on other mobile applications; 2) physical interactions that are not based on phone call or messages.\nFirst, for the social interactions happening on other platforms, it is indeed unobservable in our data set. However, based on the market share of the most popular mobile messaging channels, our data covered the leading four channels (Whatsapp, Phone calls, Facebook messager and Texting (SMS):\nTherefore, we suppose that our data has covered the majority of mobile communication activities.\nSecond, in terms of the unobserved offline social interactions, there could be two categories:\n\nSmartphone users‚Äô offline social interactions were initiated by online communication and then it was swithed to offline social interaction. In this situation , the activation of social network is activated by smartphone communication. This scenario could support our 1 & and 2 hypothesis: activating embedded contacts and interacting with them could facilitate offline social engagement.\nThe primary concern is the offline social interaction is independent of smartphone communication. In another word, the activation of social network is not based on smartphone communication. Nevertheless, 67.91% (90134/132709) of our observations are in session, which means students are on campus. For those observations, unobserved social interactions within family are ruled out. We speculate that students started with online social engagement except those with their roommates.\n\n\n\n3\nThe implications from your findings are also not clear. The current results show reduced smartphone use when engaging high ‚Äúcore-number‚Äù contacts. Does this suggest that one should have more interactions with such contacts to minimize their screen time? But the effect seems to be muted for the heaviest smartphone users, meaning this strategy wouldn‚Äôt be effective for those who might be really addicted.\nWe identified smartphone users who are addicted to smartphone. To the best of knowledge, there is no quantitative definition of smartphone addiction. We define smartphone addiction based on multiple criterias:\n\nObservations with daily screen time that are greater than 5 hours (300 minutes).\nObservations with daily screen time that are ranked top 10%, 20%, 30% among population.\nTop 10 % screen time observations for each individuals‚Äô observations.\n\nWe then estimated the probability of addiction with a logit model:\n\\(\\begin{align} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\text { Addiction }_{i t}=1 \\mid \\boldsymbol{X}_{i t}\\right)}{1-\\operatorname{Pr}\\left(\\text { Addiction }_{i t}=1 \\mid \\boldsymbol{X}_{i t}\\right)}\\right) &= \\nonumber \\\\ &\\quad \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\cdot \\text{Social Network Features}_{it} \\nonumber \\\\ &\\quad+ \\alpha \\cdot X_{it} + \\theta_{i} +\\lambda_{t} + \\varepsilon_{it}\\end{align}\\)\nAll estimation results show that the increase in core number is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of smartphone addiction. For example:\n\n\n\n4\nDoes a single interaction by call/text suffice to trigger this effect?\nCan you provide more thoughts on the results?\nIn the first version of this paper, the activation threshold is communication event &gt; 0. However, there could be a situation that the contacts did not respond to the information, which lead to a failed activation. I adjust it as follows: a contact is activated if any of the two conditions is met:\n1) the communication event type¬†is a Call;\n2) the communication event type is a message (SMS, MMS, or WhatsApp) and there are both ‚Äòoutgoing‚Äù and‚Äôincoming‚Äù messages (SMS, MMS, or WhatsApp).\nThe above two conditions could ensure a¬†two-way¬†communication (an effective activation) exists between two smartphone users.¬†This eliminates the possibility of one-way communication: one only sends or receives¬†communication information. Overall, the estimation results are mostly consistent with earlier results after the adjustment.\n\n\n\n5\nIt could be also interesting to explore how this effect vary by individual‚Äôs perceived loneliness, their social interaction level, or maybe the timing of activation (e.g., morning vs night), etc.\nThe third hypothesis is adjusted as follow:\nAn increase in communication with contacts with a high degree centrality improves the effectiveness of degree centrality in reducing smartphone usage.\n\n\n6\nSmartphone addiction is measured by duration of smartphone use. But certain usages like seeking information or connecting can be productive. Why not consider defining addiction as screentime over a certain threshold?\nPlease refer to response 3.\n\n\n7\n‚ÄúActivation‚Äù of a contact in a social media is determined by a single message or call. Shouldn‚Äôt the frequency of interactions be considered? Would a weighted average make more sense here?\nIn robustness check, we adjust the activtion threshold as two-way communication. Please refer to response 4.\n\n\n8\nIn Figure 5, you handle missing contact information by referencing from the past or future. How often does such missing information happen? Wouldn‚Äôt it be more appropriate to rely on the most recent survey only in order to capture the dynamic relationship?\nWe conducted a lookup operation to search for the missing contacts‚Äô social network information from the closest neighbors‚Äô social network surveys.\n\nWe also conducted an alternative lookup approach by searching for the missing contacts backward first and then forward.\n\nBoth results are consistent with our original analysis:\n\n\n\n9\nFollowing the above point, how did you handle new relationships that emerged between biannual surveys?\nPlease refer to response 8.\n\n\n10\nFigure 7 exemplifies social network activation. I‚Äôm curious about the repeated communications with a few out-of-network contacts: are these inbound or outbound? If these are mostly inbound with no response or occurred at regular times, it might be more reasonable to classify them as potential ads/promotions and exclude them from analysis.\n\nNon-human contacts (promotions, advertising, fishing) are ruled out.\nWe conducted two-way activation threshold to ensure that activation of social network is successful.\n\n\n\n11\nPersonality was included as a control. Shouldn‚Äôt it remain consistent for an individual? If so, you should drop it from the fixed-effect model.\nPersonalities are measured based on social surveys so they could change over surveys. Due to the missing information for certain participants, we excluded the information for now.\n\n\n12\nIt‚Äôs not necessary to write three functions for total, communication, and non-communication screen time; the model is the same.\nThank you, it is corrected in the manuscript.\n\n\n13\nBased on the # observations, the unit of analysis seems to be person-week, but in your model and results, ‚Äút‚Äù indicates day. Please clarify.\nThank you, the structure of the data is individual * day. However, time fixed effect is at the week level (studyweeks), even though our panel data is structured at potentially a more granular (daily) level with date\n\n\n14\nYour hypothesis 3 is about perceived loneliness but the results are missing. ¬†What is the relationship between the perceived loneliness and one‚Äôs actual communication pattern?\nThe third hypothesis is adjusted as follow:\nAn increase in communication with contacts with a high degree centrality improves the effectiveness of degree centrality in reducing smartphone usage.\n\n\n15\nPlease make the tables/figures self-explanatory. For example, in Table 6 it‚Äôs unclear which column corresponds to which subsample. In Table 4, please specify the units for each variable.\nThank you, please refer to the manuscript for the recent correction in formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nIzuma, K. 2017. ‚ÄúThe Neural Bases of Social Influence on Valuation and Behavior.‚Äù In, 199‚Äì209.

However, the current social network surveys are not¬†enough to cover all the contacts in the communication events. For example, let‚Äôs say an individual communicated with contact C¬†on a day in the spring semester of 2016. However, contact C was not reported in the survey of the 2016 spring; instead, contact C was reported in the survey of the 2015 Fall. Contact C is taken as relation unknown¬†or closeness unknown¬†if we only match communication with the current surveys. In paper 2, we meet the same issue while constructing an individual‚Äôs social networks. We solve it by looking up the missed contacts in a broaden pool of surveys. Specifically, we looking up the missed contacts in: 1) complete¬†social network surveys in which the focal person participated; or, 2) surveys with limitations to the closest N¬†neighboring waves. In this example, we can identify contact C‚Äôs social relationship and closeness in the survey of the fall of 2015.\nIn this update, we applied a similar look-up strategy for Paper 1. By doing this, the communication events from closeness unknown contacts and relationship unknown contacts decreased. In contrast, those from identified contacts increased. The following figures illustrate a comparison of the proportions of communication categories with different look-up strategies."

    "text": "2 Does social media make anxiety?\nIn the era of digitalization, social media has become so pervasive that the number of users has reached 5.04 billion as of January, 2024, which accounts for 62.3% of the total population. While multiple studies show that using social media may cause anxiety for users,. One reason is that individuals tend to selectively post or disclose the best about themselves, which may change other users‚Äô reference points. For example, job candidates may share their offers and packages on social media. However, those who are willing to share the information are usually those above average. This may improve the other individual‚Äôs reference point , decrease their self-efficacy, and increase anxiety. According to social comparison theory, this may impact an individual‚Äôs self-evaluation. Therefore, we conjecture that social media positively improves individuals reference points and increases anxiety levels."

However, the expansion of Medicaid also increased access to contraception, which may have reduced the number of unwanted pregnancies and the demand for abortion services. Therefore, the impact of Medicaid expansion on abortion rates is ambiguous(Eliason, Daw, and Allen 2022).

Telehealth abortion is a safe and effective way to access abortion services. Medication abortion accounted for 39% of all abortions in 2017. This number increased to 63% in 2022 (Jones and Friedrich-Karnik 2024). Telehealth abortion has been shown to increase access to abortion services, reduce the abortion stigma.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo investigate the impact of telehealth abortion on abortion rates, we plan to use a difference-in-differences approach to compare changes in abortion rates in states that expanded telehealth abortion to those that did not.\n\n‚ÄúAll telehealth abortions are counted according to¬†the state the medications are mailed to.‚Äù This approach of defining and counting telehealth aborting is used by¬†WeCount, an institution for studying abortion.

I suggest acknowledging a few more relevant studies as examples to strengthen the identified gap. For instance, some studies differentiate between communication and non-communication activities or do use objective measures, but they still provide mixed findings. Cabre-Riera et al.¬†(2019), not cited in the current manuscript, use Actigraph measures, look at different activities, but adopt a cross sectional design and does not look at the communication source (i.e., close versus non-close contacts). Lemola et al.¬†(2015), not cited in the current manuscript, also look at different activities, but use subjective data and does not look at the communication source. Tettamant et al.¬†(2020), not cited in the current manuscript, look at communication with a longitudinal design and objective measures, but does not look at the communication source. In this section, you may mention briefly. In the later sections (e.g., Section 2.2.), you may explain with just a few sentences.\n\nCabr√©-Riera A, Torrent M, Donaire-Gonzalez D, Vrijheid M, Cardis E, Guxens M (2019) Telecommunication devices use, screen time and sleep in adolescents.

Compared to the existing discourse, your study is actually offering more.\nFor the research implications, I suggest breaking this section into three paragraphs and elaborating on three key contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the practical implications, I suggest one paragraph with two main implications. As noted in the Introduction, your work can inform the practice of therapists or physicians who work with patients with sleep issues. These healthcare professionals can ask patients about their technology use habits and design personalized tips. The ideas are there in the manuscript. You just need to extend and elaborate with examples of potential ‚Äòcourses of action‚Äô.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI suggest bringing the additive and reductive pathways perspective as one approach that you draw on to capture the dual role of technology use. This approach is a step to resolve conflicting or inconsistent findings, which could be a contribution or a research implication. Then, you can elaborate on the nuances in technology use as another contribution. Then, you can also highlight the methodological aspect (e.g., longitudinal, objective). The ideas are there in the earlier parts of the manuscript. You just need to elaborate and highlight their value."

    "text": "2 Methodology\n\n2.1 Data\nCounty by month level natality observations.\n\n\n2.2 Model\nAs the parall trend assumption is hard to satisfy in this study, I made a synthetic Texas with states (e.g., New York and California) with abortion free policies and take it as control group. I use a synthetic difference-in-difference estimator (Arkhangelsky et al. 2021) to examine the effects of the two policies on abortions. The matrix for the estimator is as follows:\n\\[\nY = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\pmb{Y}_{pre, co} & \\pmb{Y}_{pre, tr} \\\\\n    \\pmb{Y}_{post, co} & \\pmb{Y}_{post, tr} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nRecall the Diff-in-Diff estimator:\n\\[\nY_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Post_t + \\beta_2 Treated_i + \\beta_3 Treated_i  Post_t + e_{it}\n\\]\nwe fit unit (\\(\\alpha_i\\)) and time (\\(\\beta_t\\)) averages, alongside the treatment indicator.\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau}^{did} = \\underset{\\mu, \\alpha, \\beta, \\tau}{argmin} \\bigg\\{ \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^T \\big(Y_{it} - (\\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_t + \\tau D_{it}\\big)^2 \\bigg\\}\n\\]\nand the Synthetic Controls:\n\\[\n\\hat{w}^{sc} = \\underset{w}{\\mathrm{argmin}} \\ ||\\pmb{\\bar{y}}_{pre, tr} - \\pmb{Y}_{pre, co} \\pmb{w}_{co}||^2_2\n\\] \\[\n\\text{s.t } \\ \\sum w_i = 1 \\text{ and } \\ w_i &gt; 0 \\ \\forall \\ i\n\\]\nwhere the outcome \\(\\pmb{Y}_{pre, co}\\) is a \\(T_{pre}\\) by \\(N_{co}\\) matrix, where the columns are the units and the rows are the time periods. \\(\\pmb{w}_{co}\\) is a \\(N_{co}\\) by 1 column vector, with one entry for each unit. Finally, \\(\\pmb{\\bar{y}}_{pre, tr}\\) is a \\(T_{pre}\\) by 1 column vector, where each entry is the time average of the treated units in the pre-treatment period.\nThe values of synthetic control group before and after treatment is:\n\\[\n\\pmb{y}_{sc} = \\pmb{Y}_{co}\\hat{\\pmb{w}}^{sc}\n\\]\nthe average treatment effects (\\(ATT\\)) are as follows:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau} =  \\bar{y}_{post, tr} - \\bar{y}_{post, sc}\n\\]\nLet‚Äôs say we have a matrix of treatment assignments \\(D\\), where the columns of the matrix are units and rows of the matrix are time periods.\n\\[\nD = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    \\vdots \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & \\dots & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWe merge the equations of DiD and SC and obtain the estimator of SDiD:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\tau}^{sdid} = \\underset{\\mu, \\alpha, \\beta, \\tau}{argmin}  \\bigg\\{ \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{t=1}^T \\big(Y_{it} - (\\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_t + \\tau D_{it}\\big)^2 \\hat{w}^{sdid}_i \\hat{\\lambda}^{sdid}_t \\bigg\\}\n\\]"
