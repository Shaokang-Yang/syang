This suggests that part of the effect of screen time on sleep debt operates through its impact on message frequency. Although the impact on the message is relatively small (0.014), since the message is measured in quartiles, it still could have a big impact.\n\n    -   The proportion of the total effect that is mediated (approx. 2.2%) indicates that a small but significant portion of the relationship between screen time and sleep debt is explained by message frequency.\n\n5.  **Summary:**\n\n    -   Increased screen time is associated with both increased message and reduced sleep debt.\n\n    -   The direct effect of screen time on sleep debt is strong and negative, meaning screen time directly contributes to reducing sleep debt.\n\n    -   There is a significant but small mediation effect through message frequency, suggesting that part of the way screen time affects sleep debt is by influencing message frequency.\n\n    -   Overall, the total effect of screen time on sleep debt, considering both direct and indirect pathways, is significant and negative.\n\n## After turning point\n\n![](images/paste-7.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](images/mediation%20-%20after-5.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### **Sobel-Goodman Mediation Tests**\n\n1.  **Indirect, Direct, and Total Effects:**\n\n    -   **a_coefficient (Effect of IV on MV):** The effect of the independent variable on the mediator is -0.001, which is not statistically significant (p = 0.209).\n\n    -   **b_coefficient (Effect of MV on DV):** The effect of the mediator on the dependent variable is -2.531 and is statistically significant (p \\< 0.001).\n\n    -   **Indirect_effect_aXb (Mediation Effect):** The indirect effect, calculated as the product of a and b coefficients, is 0.003 but not statistically significant (p = 0.220).\n\n    -   **Direct_effect_c' (Direct Effect of IV on DV):** The direct effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is 0.310, which is significant (p \\< 0.001).\n\n    -   **Total_effect_c (Total Effect of IV on DV):** The total effect is 0.313, also significant (p \\< 0.001).\n\n2.  **Proportions and Ratios:**\n\n    -   **Proportion of total effect that is mediated:** About 0.9% of the total effect is mediated, which is quite small.\n\n    -   **Ratio of indirect to direct effect:** The indirect effect is approximately 0.9% of the direct effect.\n\n    -   **Ratio of total to direct effect:** The total effect is 1.009 times the direct effect.\n\n### **Interpretation:**\n\n-   **Mediation Effect:** The results suggest that the mediation effect in the model is not statistically significant. This implies that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is not significantly channeled through the mediator.\n\n-   **Direct Effect:** The direct relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is significant and represents the main pathway of influence.\n\n-   **Total Effect:** The overall effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is significant, predominantly driven by the direct pathway.\n\n-   Messages still help¬†reduce sleep debt **(-2.531\\*\\*\\*),**¬†but the mediation effect is not significant anymore because the channel from screen time to message is cut off (**not significant**). This is a bit different from our earlier results since the interaction term (screen time \\* message)¬†earlier suggests¬†that their combination could negatively impact sleep debt.\n\n-   **Mediation Proportion:** The small proportion of mediation suggests that the mediator plays a negligible role in the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in this particular analysis.\n\n### Outlier Handling\n\nAccording to the **1.5 IQR rule**, observations with messages \\> 20 or unlocks \\> 23.5 should be taken as outliers.
