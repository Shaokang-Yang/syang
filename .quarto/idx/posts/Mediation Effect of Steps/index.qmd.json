Evidence suggests that physical activity could negatively impact the time people spend on smartphones [@precht2023]. We divide participants into sedentary, medium, and active categories based on their average daily steps walked.The descriptive statistics are summarized in Table 6. The \"Sedentary\" group comprises the participants with the lowest 25% average daily steps; the \"Medium\" group represents the participants whose average daily steps rank from 25% to 75% among the complete cohort of participants; and the \"Active\" group refers to the participants whose average daily steps rank above the top 25%. Overall, we observe that the three groups daily steps are negatively associated with screen time, indicating that physically active individuals spend less time on their smartphones. Building on the descriptive results, we evaluate whether the impact of network features is influenced by physical activity level.\n\n![](images/paste-2.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nTable 8 shows the estimation results for the moderating impact of physical activity on network features. Columns 1-3 show how network features impact screen time as physical activity increases based on activation threshold of 1 communication event. We observe that the effectiveness of the core number in curbing smartphone overuse decreases with physical activity levels. The core number is particularly impactful in curbing screen time for people who live a sedentary lifestyle. Specifically, one standard deviation in core number (SD = 3.724) leads to a 14.12-minute decrease in total screen time. The effectiveness of the core number diminishes for the medium-active group and becomes insignificant for the active group. This might be due to the limited space for reduction for the active group, as the screen time of the active group is significantly lower than that of the sedentary and medium groups, see Table 6. We utilize alternative activation threshold in columns 4-6 and set feature borrowing limitation in columns 7-9, the estimation results are similar to those in columns 1-3. In conclusion, the results of this section indicate that the impact of the network feature (core number) is influenced by physical activity. Activating contacts with high core numbers is particularly effective for curbing smartphone overuse for those who live a **sedentary lifestyle**.\n\n![](images/paste-10.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Mediation Analysis\n\nSince the impact of core number diminishes as physical activity (steps) increases, we explore whether the impact of core number is mediated by steps. We conjecture that activating contacts with high core number reduces screen time **by increasing individuals' daily steps**. We examine our conjecture by conducting a mediation analysis. The descriptive statistics of the IV(Total core number), mediator(steps) and DV( Screen time) is as follow:\n\n![](images/paste-7.png)\n\n### Sobel-Goodman Mediation Tests\n\n(Two-Way Activation Threshold with Borrowing Limitation to Closest 1 Neighbor)\n\n``` python\nsgmediation2 unlock_time, iv(tcore) mv(steps) cv(degree_centrality inactive_nodes out_contacts num_edges \nminsasleep trust close position duration in_com out_com duration2 community  naps nap_minsasleep \ni.insession i.weekday i.studyweek i.egoid)\n```\n\n![](images/paste-6.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n-   **a_coefficient:** impact of total core number on steps (100 steps)\n\n-   **b_coefficient:** impact of steps on screen time (min)\n\n-   **Indirect_effect_aXb:** a_coefficient ⨉ b_coefficient, which is the impact of core number on screen time through steps\n\n-   **Direct_effect_c':** impact of total core number on screen time\n\n-   **Total_effect_c:** Indirect_effect_aXb + Direct_effect_c', which is the total effect of total core number on screen time\n\n![](images/mediation%20-%20before.png)\n\nHere we use total core number as our main independent variable, which is the product of **activated contacts** ⨉ **core number of each activated contacts**.
